0,"Good Morning r/wow! Welcome to the World First Race Megathread for Azshara's Eternal Palace.

Threads related to the race will be consolidated into this one and comments will be sorted by new to foster discussion. Once Azshara's secret Kungen phase is over and a guild achieves world first, we'll leave this thread up for an hour or so before locking it and replacing it with a ""World First Wrap-up"" thread. The Wrap-up thread will serve as a place for continuing the World First discussion after a guild has secured the #1 spot. 

A thread congratulating the winning guild will be allowed outside of the main discussion stickies as usual, along with a separate one showing the kill video. 

**We ask that you remain civil and follow our [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/rules#wowbtn). Cheer for the guild you most want to win but don't resort to attacking people who cheer for another guild.**

Its unique and fun.  I actually preferred the legion version better but it was clunky.  Bfa streamlined it and it could use some more tuning in terms of direction but mechanically it's a beast and I'm happy to see it do well.

26,"I really wish there was more of a variety in timewalking dungeon events. Why are we limited to 3 or 4 dungeons total when there's like, double or triple that depending on the xpac? **This seems like such an unnecessary limitation**

&amp;#x200B;

*Think Steamvaults, Slabs, Bottanica, Burial grounds, UBRS, Halls of Origination, Auch crypts, Forge of Souls, Culling, Cata revamps like VC, SFK SM. and so many others.*

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know there's a couple or so near-universally disliked dungeons like oculus, grim batol or shado pan monastery even, but this can't be preventing others being added. Just remove them from the queue pool. (and by them I mean literally 1 or 2) Or make it so you have to specifically opt in for that. Also it's hard to make that argument when we already have pretty cruddy dungeons included like the violet swamp.

&amp;#x200B;

Another point against this idea is that a lot of the dungeons are ones you did while leveling, (think ramparts) so they shouldn't. well under the most simple level of scrutiny you'd find out that already a large amount of the current tw dungeons are ones you've leveled up alts in (mana tombs, jade temple, vortex pinnacle etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this isn't a major part of the game but it's still a small improvement that would make things feel more fresh, even if only slightly. Just another one of those small things that only helps, even if ever so slightly. What do you think??",Timewalking Dungeon Selection - Is it too limited?,1

take Boralus portal to IF, fly to Menethil Harbor, take the boat to Howling Fjord, fly from Howling Fjord to Dalaran, and take the Caverns of Time portal before flying up there.


There is a Caverns of Time portal in SW. Why wouldn't I just go there?

I have socketed bracers too, but they're the pufferfish ones which seem to be performing quite average for me.   


Thank you",[Benethic] Is there a BIS list of Benethic gear for each spec?,1
32,"So, I'm trying to find out if anyone knows of any add-ons that might assist disabled players.

I currently raid in my guild as a havoc demon hunter.  I only have one hand, and right now, I play with a Razer Naga.  

I do my best to keep up with DPS, and I do tend to suffer from a slow learning curve to try to get down mechanics.   I have my talents set for the best options for single target rotation for raid, according to online research.  My talents match the other demon hunters in my guild.  I still can't seem to make up the difference in DPS.  I seem to be hitting the rotation correctly, but I know I have at least two spells I can't hotkey because I'm out of space on my Naga.   

I also worry that I'm probably suffering from challenged mobility because I only play with one hand,  which I know you guys can't help with. 

I just want to see what other disabled WoW gamers are using, or if anyone has ideas on how I can try to improve my game play. 

Thanks!!

If you want a  idea of my averages:

I'm currently suffering from mechanics on palace, and I'm averaging 5-10k behind the other demon hunters.   It was 15k behind before I switched my talent build, so I have made up 5k.

Once I get down mechanics, I'm still 3-4k behind the other demon hunters, on average.",Are there any add-ons that help disabled players?,1

I already purchased him a canvas with lich king for him for our anniversary and the cookbook for Valentine’s Day. I’ll like to keep the gift to under 100 dollars. Oh I’m also in Canada. Thank you 💖",Does anyone have any good WoW themed gift ideas?,1
35,"I really liked having bandages on classes which don't have good self sustain. I know I can buy them / craft them in tailoring, but it was really handy to have it on multiple chars.

36,,Fel Burn,1
37,"N'zoth will not be involved much in 8.3 besides probable invasions in cities etc. 

The long-standing theory is that all three Warbringers will be bosses in each patch.
Meaning Jaina was 8.1
Azshara 8.2
And Sylvanas 8.3
However, like every other Warbringer, she won't die (permanently at least).

Sylvanas has set up Baine's capture as if she knew he'll be rescued. She wants the attention to be on an imminent attack on Thunder Bluff. While Thrall and Jaine will be distracted in Thunder Bluff, Derek Proudmoore will assassinate Katherine Proudmoore.

This effectively renders the Alliance fleet useless. With Jaina in Kalimdor, and Katherine dead, the Kul Tirans have no senior to issue a response in case of an attack.

Jaina will distrust Baine and Thrall again, believing Baine delivered Derek deliberately.

Sylvanas then begins an attack on Stormwind which was always her ultimate goal. There is no fleet to save the city. It might as well be burnt bringing true the vision of Stormwind we saw in Siege of Orgrimmar.

She ends up being a boss in the raid.
In the End Times Dungeon in Cataclysm, we saw her being easily able to raise bodies in undeath. Being at Stormwind would mean she'll have a huge amount of people at her disposal to raise in undeath. Jaina, Baine and Tyrande therefore ensure their visions in the End Time dungeon come true as well.

However, there's a question of concluding the story of Azshara considering she is one of three Warbringers. Stormwind is also one of the few cities directly connected to water. It'll be perfect for her to attack Stormwind benefitting as a third party in the conflict with her Naga through the sea.

The conclusion or the raid itself will also answer Sylvanas and Xal'atath and what secret mission she send Nathanos for in Nazjatar.

What may not be concluded is the whole story of N'zoth, Vol'jin seeking answers and his true nature itself.

Sylvanas' defeat may result in her retreating (and going to the Lich King in desperation) and solving the problem of the infinite Warfronts.

8.3 may also start involving the Infinite Dragonflight as they served N'zoth so that they're set up for 9.0 as well as Wrathion and the Black Dragonflight. 

Or nothing will happen this way.",What happens in Patch 8.3?,1
38,,Just a reminder that we were warned this would happen,1

Hopefully this makes sense.",Azeroth Autopilot Query,1
43,"Is the iron docks gold farm strategy even worth the payoff in bfa? I ran it 6 times and got around 3000 gold i think, does anyone still farm this? Not saying it's bad, i just didn't know if it's good in bfa.",Iron Docks gold farm,1
44,"I just unlocked flying last night, is there anything worth going back to do in Zandalar/Kul Tiras that wasn’t as easy to farm/do when we couldn’t fly?",Just unlocked flying. What am I missing out on?,1
45,"Yeah, getting rid of Tier sets was such a great idea, it opens design space yadda yadda


But wait, see this ""catchup"" gear here? Let's just make it so it can get a socket, but random! And if that's not enough, make some of them completely useless! Also make it BIS in the new raid, but unusable everywhere else - You know players love to carry around multiple items for each slot! Players will love to grind up Alts to farm the Pearls. 


This is probably the thought process behind the new Bethinc gear. They do the opposite of what was intended: Instead of me gearing up my alts with it I'm leveling more alts to farm more mana pearls to send Bethnic Disappointment to my main who stil doesn't have two of the items. 

To be honest, I hate Bethnic gear.",Bethnic gear is just the new Tier set - but worse,1

50,"So upon activation every world quest i do whether its in Zandalar, Kul-Tiras, Mechagon or Nazjatar will i be rewarded only the reputation to which ever faction it was assigned for? That every world quest will reward me with 10 reputation right? And would it be possible to buy a bulk of those contracts for a specific faction and only use them when you've completed all of the important world quests with the reputation that is still most important to me for that day and then activate the contract and do the remaining un-important world quests with the contract and then be able to remove the contract once I'm done and repeat the next day when every world quest resets? Or do contracts work differently and you have to stay through its duration?",Do i understand correctly how rep contracts work?,1
51,"I've just finished listening to the Legion audio dramas and the following paragraphs relating to Alleria Windrunner stood out as foreshadowing:

""More visions. Possible futures. She saw Xe'ra, the Mother of Light, declaring her a heretic and calling for her death. She saw her blood on Turalyon's sword. She saw Arator calling an army of paladins to hunt her down, only to fall with her arrows in his throat. She saw herself kneeling before the One Who Slumbers beneath Azeroth's waves. She saw herself killing it and taking its place, leading a throng of horrors to consume every nation.
As she swam in the Shadow, all these visions seemed true. At first.
Slowly she began to see the difference between the Shadow's memories... the Shadow's plans... and the
Shadow's desires. And from that...
Destiny. She saw what the Light could not. She saw what even the Shadow could not, because, yes, it
was just as blind.
She saw terrible choices. She saw noble betrayals. She saw... victory, in a way she could scarcely comprehend.
And among all of that, she saw countless events that would never happen. The lies of the Void were strong, intoxicating, but they quickly collapsed.
Perhaps one day she would fall to madness. Perhaps one day she would betray her allies. She was capable of it... 
But it was not yet time. She had witnessed herself jumping from a cliff, peacefully surrendering to the long fall.""

Alleria does state that these are lies however Xe'ra did declare her a heretic meaning that at least one of the visions came true. 
The one slumbering beneath the waves is most likely N'Zoth.
As we know, Alleria hasn't tried to kill herself by jumping off a cliff, but her sister has. So what if these visions are about Sylvanas instead of herself?",A hint from the past?,1

62,"Hi everyone. I’m 25 years old and I have finally decided to give WoW a shot after all this time. I originally never played it around the time of its initial release due to the fact that I was investing a large portion of my time in Runescape, and also the fact that I didn’t think it was something that was really worth playing. 

I’ve come to find out that I was 100% wrong all this time. After investing about 7 hours into the game I’ve realized that I have sincerely missed out on such a fun and addicting RPG, and sadly enough I wished I would’ve played it years ago. 

I was wondering if there is any advice or tips from the sub I could get in regards to how the game works and how I should be playing it. I’ve started playing as a Human Warrior and I am currently sitting at level 6. 

I’ve mainly been devoting my time to side quests I come across as to not miss out on bits of lore or items. 

Is there anything I need to be doing?
Is there anything I shouldn’t waste my time on?

Back when a hunter could get exotic pets around level 10, she had managed to obtain several exotic animals that can not be used anywhere except the Wandering Isle.

Does this mean I need to find some way to grind her up to 65th level without ever completing her introductory Pandaran plots and without ever leaving the Wandering Isle, just so that she can access her exotic pets?

Main point will be merging LFR and Normal: (1) Heavy presence of npc whos bubble heads trying to teach you mechanics of raid with some story elements; (2) Smaller than LFR for easier coordination; (3) Fight difficulties around current normal, maybe tone down heavy-coordination mechanics if there's any.

What is the point in giving these fake leaks any attention, all it does is make them more popular. There should really be a rule that states that posting ""leaks"" are banned, especially those coming from 4chan.

Thus far, 4 ""leaks"" as of today have been released (in the last month) by people claiming to work for Blizzard. All 4 so far have claimed different things, ranging from the name of the expansion, the content, the zone(s), etc.

No employee, especially after the purge that happened not too long ago, is going to risk their job just to try and tell people what the next expansion is. It's not hard to photoshop things together to make believable pictures, or come up with ideas and create made up expansion concepts.

I am fine with people having fun, but by claiming these obvious fanfictions are ""leaks"" is really just a step into annoying. If you're going to come up with these expansion ideas, you'd be better of just posting it on reddit to share it, and simply be truthful by saying it was a neat idea you had.

Otherwise, all you're asking for is attention. I wouldn't even be surprised if the people posting on the reddit bringing up each 4chan leak is the original fabricator in the first place. So please, just stop. None of the leaks have been true so far, and I'd be willing to give a wow token to anyone that winds up ""leaking"" something legitimate.

I’ve seen this topic touched on here and there, but how difficult would it be to create a housing aspect to Warcraft, and on top of that, to create a housing aspect that is permanent and useful beyond one expac? It seems like it would be a very doable thing, and that you could even have multiple options for what to pursue in regard to type of housing even. One of the things I kept thinking back in Legion was about my class hall and how that was a missed opportunity. I was in the mage hall. One string of quests took you up into the apartment of an npc mage. I kept thinking that beyond the use of the class hall itself, why not be able to acquire your own apartment in that tower? Same for other class halls... each could have an option. I know Blizzard has a habit of abandoning everything that originated with its last expac and starting over on most things with each expac, but I think they may be overlooking trying to make some things more permanent and useful from expac to expac, and not just the stormwind auction house and portal room. Focusing the only permanent places in one location drains the life from the rest of the world, and also makes it feel less realistic that way. I would love to have a personal housing space which should also be customizable in certain ways and have activities you can do to evolve it (those could change from expac to expac).

A boe drop here and there can go a long way toward a regular player supporting their own personal costs in the game. I understand flasks and feasts have a cost. However, some of the boes go for quite a lot of gold, more than I think is reasonable for a regular non-officer member to be required to donate the the guild. This policy has made me feel like I don't want to donate to the guild bank at all, which I typically have done in other guilds. 

A regularly raiding heroic/mythic progression guild shouldn't really have need for members to equip boe drops. I think the people that buy these things on the ah are probably people who are gearing alts/changing mains/catching up.

157,"Hello.I'm completely interested in WoW right now (BFA), I have never played it before and it's the first MMO that I simply cannot decide which 'main' character I should play. I intent to have more characters if I'm interested in more variety of playstyles but I also feel the need to focus on a main character with as much content as possible. This main character I want it to be able to do most content of the game without the pressure to reach a 'softlock' (not being able to do stuff due to being impossible or very bad).

My goals are mostly PvE (dungeons/raids) and PvP only in groups. After testing a few classes (warrior, shaman, mage, rogue and warlock) at a very low level I think I have decided to pick Warlock, it seems fun and matches a cool theme. I have done a few dungeons and with Arcane mage and Fury Warrior and I did a very solid DPS (skada addon), and whenever I play with Warlock my DPS is very sucky. Is this a low level 'problem' or should I be worried about the utility of Warlocks in general?

I'm mainly asking this question because I wanna feel invested without the constant fear of regret after 9999 hours of gameplay. Searching on the internet cannot answer me this question and that's why I'm choosing to ask here, I'm tired to reroll characters and testing low level stuff, I just wanna dive right into the progress with more confidence. I simply don't know ANY of WoW, I have decent mechanics and I'm a fast learner (from past games) however this game and its meta is just brand new (kinda overwhelming to be honest, too much content ahead of me).

I have this ultimate question: Should I roll a Warlock and feel confident that I can run 'top tier' PvE content being useful and enjoying my class? At low level there are other classes that simply do 3x better than me such as warrior and arcane mage that I tested and that's so sad the difference but it could be a false impression since I'm guessing the game will drastically change by the endgame. I like to get into competitive PvE, but not so hardcore to a point where I MUST choose the TOP TIER classes and min max everything, I just wanna KNOW if the long run will be worth it for this class. and I also know that the 'meta' changes regurlarly but I'm looking for a NICHE that I simply CAN'T find right now (I think this is related to the class pruning that the community have being vocal about). I really liked tanking but I feel the pressure of not knowing the dungeons and relying way too much on others to move around when they're expecting the tank to guide the run (which is correct), I could play a tank in the future whenever I feel more comfortable with the game, but for now I have decided that it's best to pick a dps and just go with the flow and learn the game more.

The Legion could have taken over Azeroth, however even in their home base in Argus, there were still pockets of resistance.

The Old Gods have to play a long game of slowly corrupting the races of Azeroth to do their bidding so that they may wage war in hopes of freeing themselves admist the chaos.

You get my point.
What does King Mechagon have to do to utterly fuck Azeroth up though? He merely gets to use some stupid gizmo and every race on the entire fucking planet that wasnt formerly made of stone or metal gets destroyed magically..  Of course our ""Champions"" put a stop to that and saved the world yet again however... 

Honestly the writing behind the threat King Mechagon poses is so cheap and overthetop in my opinion. You could have made him a compelling villain just through the fact that he is a sick and murderous maniac, but everything has to be a castaprohic world ending threat I guess...

Makes me appreciate the more modest storytelling within the game at least, such as the Thunder King.

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, heirlooms. I used 'em, you should too honestly on your journey.  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mK9cz4hBRicQre1\_VwGdFcKxLV900ulItYYuf6frr1E/edit#gid=1414515836](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mK9cz4hBRicQre1_VwGdFcKxLV900ulItYYuf6frr1E/edit#gid=1414515836) 

I just resubbed so too poor for Hidden Satyr, but Elemental Force is amazing and the other slots if you can find them at a reasonable price, don't hurt. My numbers for DPS in DGs and performance in BGs was always competitive without neck enchant but really wish I had it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Levels 1-20**

**Average: 4 Hours, 33k EXP/hour** 

Notes: Not a bad range if you have the heirloom achievement mount. 1-10 should be about an hour but its once you move out from starting area that things slow down. I did Azuremyst + Bloodmyst fully to 40, Eversong + Ghostlands fully to 45, and every quest in Elwynn got me to 21. So not a whole lot of traveling, but its just the nature of the quests that they won't be super close together and without running around. I also try to keep up professions while leveling so flower picking and mining time included. Also, battlegrounds open at 10. WSG is fun but AB with no mounts is rough. At 15 the dungeons open, the starting ones are all good except WC. What has been working for me is staying queued for BGs and dungeons at all times since the scaling changes. In a 2 hour session, it all adds up even if the dungeon runs feels slow. The bonus EXP at the end from that, and winning a BG is immense. Can't use warmode here yet unfortunately but right at 20, turn it on along with mount training. The main point here is that it was enjoyable to stay and finish zones completely instead of starting new chains of quests every 5 levels. And that way may be more quick if you know the routes well enough, but sticking around works. 

&amp;#x200B;

**20-60**

**Average: 10 Hours, 140k - 400k EXP/hour**

Notes: This range used to drag back in the day but now with all the EXP coming in it flies by. After doing 2 zones and BGs/DGs it's time to pick a new traveling destination around 45/50. Horde, I went and did Silverpine and 4 quests into Hillsbrad. Alliance, Westfall is super easy and quick until you get to Sentinel Hill. I usually dip out to Redridge from there or Duskwood. Very boring for me since who hasn't done that route a few times, but higher level areas take more investment to get into the 'zone' questing-wise. Darkshore is okay but bleh, personally have done it too many times. Dire Maul and other high level dungeons aren't super exciting but the EXP is solid and with loot scaling, some stuff will take you into Outland or Northrend. Picking herbs and putting pet battle restore ability on bars to keep battling as you go are good habits to get into and I personally think sped things up and kept me engaged. Rares and exploring the back of those caves for chests, easy EXP also.

&amp;#x200B;

**60-80**

**Average: 6 hours, 330-500k EXP/hour**

Notes: Here I tried to flip things around a bit. One character did HFP, that got him to 70. Went and finished in the Netherstorm to 80, did about 5 levels per 2 hours. One character did Borean, 60-72. Quested in Dragonblight from there, was just okay engagement-wise. The Horde one went HFP to 69, then Zangarmarsh to 73 then finished in Nagrand. Dungeons are great in this range, I strongly preferred TBC ones but loot tables are wide and can find useful pieces in all of them. BGs were the MVP in this range, they were fun and the wins ate up huge chunks of bars. Flying is great, never bought Artisan skill at 70 though. Usually able to afford it in the 80s, and thats with a lucky transmog sale.

&amp;#x200B;

**80-100**

**Average: 11 hours, 350-550k EXP/hour**

Notes: Fun range honestly despite nothing forward to look to, ability wise. A couple of my characters went to Hyjal and very little Deepholme, easy 5ish hours then off to Draenor. The other did Jade Forest, about similar time and maybe 30 minutes into Karasang. I've had my heirlooms since Wrath but I know some people may not have them upgraded to 100, I had to sink some gold in to keep them relevant on some pieces. But I would say its a good investment, hold on to them for dear life. 90-100, it's not bad. Between treasures and the usual solo queues and quests, very quick. The intro is probably the least enjoyable part and it feels bad leaving with so many quest markers everywhere when you do hit 100, but you can come back later is what I tell myself. Didn't really get to finish any zones here, did SMV on a couple and then tried to bounce around doing objectives on the other.

&amp;#x200B;

**110-120**

**Average 12 hours, 330k-450k EXP/hour**

Notes: Home stretch, just got to focus and grind through. Lost heirlooms and feels bad getting more EXP at 60 for quests then here but the quests and lore are very enjoyable. BGs, still great and chaotic DGs still amazing for gear and EXP. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's that. The journey is fun and engrossing, I just did one character at a time and got better each time. Sometimes the hardest part is logging in and knowing you have work to do, but once you queue up and get the questing rolling times flies by. Played with a lot of great people over this time and did my best to greet every DG group or actually communicate in BGs. Did some ganking, got ganked out in the world. Checked and updated transmog outfits every 10 levels or so, really enjoyed filling in those missing pieces on All the Things through all my dungeons. Some late nights I would go into a city, usually SW, chat in Trade and post up treasures and crafting stuff on AH then go RP or hang out just to break the grind. On my days off I wake up early and would starting leveling in the morning and have lots of adventures before lunchtime. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing to note is, I didn't find any easier ways to level fast. Kara trash runs were nerfed, (but man those were good, 10 levels in 90 minutes) and draenor potions helped but I don't think there is a way to squeeze out of questing. You just have to bite the bullet and get to work but, its not a bad thing. The game is still very much alive and there are other people all over in old zones, making their first memories or just new ones in Azeroth. Really wish I saw more people but who knows what is really going on with sharding and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

*/who being broken really sucks and yeah, outside of DGs or BGs sometimes you do feel a bit lonely and isolated. But the world of warcraft is wide and wonderous, you will run into to people in the wilds or chat up the zone you are in and see who is out there.*

&amp;#x200B;

 My final tidbit if you are a new player or veteran, addons. There are some great ones and Overachiever and AllTheThings really helped me get every bit of content I could as I went. Taking selfies or exploring for books or even eating and drinking the assortment of things you come across was fun.

Remove LFR and Mythic from the game while converting LFR to normal  and heroic to mythic in terms of difficulty. Make gear rare and hard to  get and if you’re going to give out welfare gear it should be green or  blue and only raid/pvp gear being epic.   


Remove the mythic mindset from the game and quit trying to make WoW an  e-sport and make raids fun to do with a group of people and not just  hard for the sake of being hard. WoW became super popular because it was  the easy MMO on the market and now they’re trying to be both the  easiest and hardest MMO possible and its maddening.

Remove warforging and titanforging to bring back BiS lists so we have goals to aim for.

Condense the amount of servers and remove phasing and sharding from  the game and bring server identity back. Fix world lag when doing pvp *may have something to do with sharding/phasing*

Bring attunement's back into the game but it should be account bound so  you have account progression. Any character progression in post max  level should be account bound and quit trying to milk time from the  dwindling playerbase and respect players time.

In BFA essences/AP should be account bound because you’ve already done  the content to get them. There’s no reason outside of RP reasons to not  have them be account bound and we could make special rules for RP  servers to have these be strictly character progression on RP servers.

Make professions worth having and able to craft gear that’s worth buying.

Add pvp vendors back to the game and bring back all “pvp only”  talents. PvP in ffxiv sucks and have pvp only talents. WoW shouldn’t  follow after a flawed design like pvp only talents. There’s no reason a  DK can’t use dark simulacrum outside of pvp/warmode content.

Return the game back to its roots where if you no life the game you’re stronger than the guy that  plays two hours a week. Everyone want’s to feel rewarded for the time  they put into the game.

Stop resetting power every new patch making the past content  irrelevant. All content of an expansion should be relevant the entire  expansion. Also give reasons for players to run previous raids in an  expansion so those returning to the game have a clear path to get geared  and see the story of the expansion.

If the developers are determined to keep LFR how about instead of  forcing abunch of people together you put a person in a solo que with  NPC’s downing bosses and at the end of it they’re awarded a single piece  of loot or ap. That way they can see the boss fights and have a chance  to get something. Perhaps even encouraging them to do harder content.",If you could change something in WoW what would it be?,1

181,"There's a few key components here that I feel really hamper BfA. I'd like to share those and the ideas that could make them feel a lot better.

1. Class Design. It sucks. They've maybe sort of acknowledged this. These rental progression systems that leave classes regutted at the end of each expansion is awful. We need more complete baseline designs. A lot of Azerite powers (not all) but many of them for example should have been baseline. The 8.2 essence system is a good example of an expansion specific class system that works fine under that model. Lots of work needs to be done here next expansion to make classes fulfilling and fun again. This needs to come both in utility/fun abilities and fleshed out damage rotations/interactions. They also need to make a serious commitment to talent design and balancing. Talent balance is hot garbage in the game, and basically always has been. Additionally I HATE the design of utility competing against mobility competing defensive talent rows. That idea needs to be scrapped. I think a lot of the damage talent rows are actually really well done in concept in BfA, they are just tuned terribly. But the mobility/defensive stuff is just bad all around.

2. Tier bonuses - I'd like to see these return. Personally, I think a hybrid of azerite and tier could be sweet. Let's assume for a moment they bake in a lot of the mandatory azerite talents (the one point wonder traits as the easiest example). I think those armor slots can be pruned down a bit (since more things will be baseline), but they could still offer some cool power picks. THEN, on top of that I'd like to see a set bonus if you are wearing any 2 pieces from the raid. A single bonus that would be similar in power/complexity to past 4pc bonuses. There are of course a lot of ways that they could do something similar to this, but I'd like to see set bonuses return to help vary up playstyle from tier to tier. Additionally I think the freedom is important here in allowing you to choose any two azerite pieces, and the two slots you prefer, as opposed to the old system of 4 specific slots that you can never change, and that the bonus doesn't work until you get them in the first place.

3. Personal Loot &amp; Trading - Personal loot needs to be tradeable, end of story. Or give us back Master Loot, I don't really care. If they are 100% committed to personal loot, remove the trading restrictions. It's pretty ridiculous how hard it is to get an item you want if you don't have hardly anyone else in your raid group that shares that loot with you. And then half the time they can't trade it anyway even if they wanted to. It feels super awful.

4. Loot targeting - My biggest complaint here is the weekly cache and the coins. The weekly cache needs to let you select the random item slot (similar to Benthic). The coins should be guaranteed to give you extra loot. I would be fine with only getting one coin per week if it always would give me loot.

5. Sockets and Tertiary Stats. Remove these as random rolls. Make sockets and tertiaries a baseline system. Sockets allow for stat customization. Tertiaries are actually generally pretty cool, but don't feel required. However in both BfA and Legion it's way too difficult to actually get them. They would be a neat stat to look for on gear, but shouldn't be part of the RNG rolls on items. I think, like gems, it should be based on a customization system.

6. Warforge/Titanforge - Limit this to 15-20 item levels. Let all items be upgraded with a currency up to that cap. WF/TF would be having one or all of those levels already procced. Let an upgraded item refund some portion of its cost to limit the fear of ""spending the currency on the wrong item""

7. Flying - I'm all for an initial limitation. I agree it makes the world feel a bit more alive at the beginning, but we need to be flying in like 3 months max. The world is great and all, but it just gets tedious. World quests, rares, chest, whatever. They only offer so much, and the convenience of flying makes everything feel SO much better. I think for new zones it can still be limited but I think tying it to rep grinds is a poor choice. I'd like to see it gated in some other fashion. I really like the focus on the world we've seen in Legion and BfA, and I hope we continue to see iteration there to make it even better. Mecha and Naz definitely aren't bad, but I know they can do more.

8. Mythic Plus - BfA M+ kinda sucks. I don't enjoy it anywhere near as much as I did in Legion. Why? Trash is designed in extremely unfun fashions, and many of the baseline affixes could essentially do with a complete redesign. Bosses in general are probably better than most Legion dungeon bosses, but that trash design...WEW LAD. I like the seasonal affix idea, and I like both Beguiling and Reaping I think they are fine affixes and vary things up. It's baseline design and baseline affixes that are the largest issues. There needs to be less of a focus on constant interrupts, and Blizzard needs be less focused on ""how do we stop them from pulling big"". I might be wrong but that feels like the guiding design philosophy behind BfA M+ is how to stop us from making big pulls. Anyway, trash in BfA sucks I'd like to see it be more similar to Legion.

9. Affixes - Necrotic, Bolstering, Bursting, and Skittish all need to be removed/redesigned. Necrotic puts all the responsibility on the single tank player and in some cases there's really not much you can do except hope things die before you can't be healed. Sure, this might be fairly rare but it's still a thing. You might ask about Grievous, but besides from it being overbuffed I think it's fine. Classes have personal defensives, you can use healing pots or healthstones, it's a healer affix but everyone in the party has tools that can help. If just needs to be nerfed a tad, and I think it's a decent affix. Bolster, Burst, and Skittish add nothing enjoyable to the dungeon. Especially in a BfA world where they decided to litter mobs with non elite mobs it is just about the most annoying thing in the game to mess with, and serve no purpose but to slow you down. Challenge and such is good, but these affixes just blow. I'd like to see them completely replaced going into the next expansion.
10. M+ Seasons - There needs to be more rewards here. I'm thinking like a combo of PvP and old challenge modes. Make seasonal cosmetic appearances, mounts, titles. 

I think warfronts are a total bust, islands are a total bust. I've played for 15 years because I like to raid, I've usually enjoyed my warrior, some fairly casual pvp, and for dungeon gameplay. Make my classes awesome to play, make M+ freaking awesome, and keep cranking out great raids? Heck man I'm sold, and it's the WoW I've always loved. I wish they would be less worried about reinventing the wheel every expansion, completely throwing out years of class design to start over, and focus more on what (to me) is what made WoW the great game it's been.

189,"For those that dont know, EU-Auchindoun used to be a server with a fair amount of competition between guilds for mythic rankings. While the server has been in decline for a while (even before Legion), many guilds have either stopped raiding or dont bother with higher bosses, transferred to higher pop realms or just disbanded alltogether.

Below are rankings from [wowprogress](https://www.wowprogress.com/pve/eu/connected-auchindoun)

* Legion Tier 19 (EN/ToV/Nighthold): 152 rankings
* Legion Tier 20 (ToS): 77 rankings
* Legion Tier 21 (Antorus): 75 rankings

* BFA Uldir: 63 rankings
* BFA Dazar'alor: 40 rankings
* BFA Crucible of Storms: 14 rankings
* BFA Eternal palace (after 1 week): 12 rankings

Over the course of BFA many of the guilds have just stopped caring. Higher guilds will clear HC, maybe do a Mythic boss and not bother. Medium guilds will do normal, maybe a few heroic and not bother. After a few weeks they will just stop raiding all together and just wait for the next patch.

Even if any player ever wanted to start playing again and possibly raid, there is almost nothing left to return to.

191,"I was just thinking to myself - I'm the kind of player who, nowadays, only subs every now and then when there's content that interests me. I grab a month (or two), do the content, and then leave - but thinking back, I used to play very differently.

I started in mid BC; not the most alt friendly the game has ever been, but it meant by the time I was hitting higher-level content, Wrath came out. So naturally, it being my first *real* taste of an endgame, it set some expectations for me. Getting alts up to speed was quick, easy, and god forbid fun.

There were a lot of options to get you back up and running then that simply don't exist now - from PvP vendors to fill in a few slots (assuming you liked PvP), to rep tabards, and later even rep tokens. Wrath wasn't perfect, mind, with its dungeons quickly becoming pure facerolls, and its first raid being almost entirely reused content, but the fact that you could get into things so easily was very appealing.

Now? I feel very reluctant to even touch my other characters, due to but not limited to systems such as Azerite. It's not *difficult* per se to get an alt back to a playable level, but such a time-consuming chore that simply not doing it for more than one character feels like the most sane option to me.

There's a problem there, though, and this is the point of my post: If I were able to play those alts without it feeling like an insurmountable grind (not even difficult, just incredibly time consuming), I'd probably keep my sub going, keep playing those characters in the downtime, experimenting with new specs and new classes.

I simply feel no incentive to do so when there's such a gigantic wall in the way. I don't think alts should just get a free ride and free gear, of course, but they've definitely gone way too far in the opposite direction with BFA, and as such it leaves me with a lot less to do during a content lull.

Well it turns out it was the background Slideshow option that created those micro freeze troughought the whole system at regular intervals

In my case I have always played with my attacks binded to my numbers pad, having most attacks from 1 to 9 and on some other keys like 0 and +, so as to move with WASD, and also having mostly cooldowns binded from F1 to F6, with some other attacks on the numbers below, so I would love to learn what others use to move and attack, if there’s an specific kind of playstyle you think is better or if it’s up to the players comfort",Keybinds and different play styles,1

So perhaps it is already applied in NA and EU wow.

1. Make an character-name (C-Name) let\`s say \[ Redditwow \] (1st)
2. Delete character and make it again with same C-Name (2nd)
3. Try to restore character 1st 
4. Since the name exist in DB, game recognize (2nd) C-Name as an unique one and force the 1st ID to change it\`s name for free without paying Blizzard.

1. Make an C-Name, delete it and make 2nd again does n\`t work now.

2. Make an C-Name, delete and make 2nd with friend\`s account does n\`t work also.

3. Call for Ticket and ask GM to restore my character to random English ID (instead of Korean)

and change it to same C-Name does n\`t work.

4. Once your C-Name is set, there are no bypass to change it for free other than paying Blizzard to do so.

I think this was a glitch in Blizzard system and they fixed it for good.

211,"It's Wednesday. Something past 6 A.M. as I make my way towards Kun-Lai Summit, towards that one notorious spot, that one notorious spawn, where many tears of joy and anger, disappointment sadness were shed. Where many were doomed to yet another week, and only few had a chance to truly say ""at last..."". Yes, I am talking about the Sha of Anger. As I make way to that dreadful patch of black Sha substance (and almost missing the tag due to writing this post), I look around and take a good look at all the beautiful structures Pandaria has to offer. The temples, the walls, the gates, the statues. Albeit somewhat ruined by the whole gloomy atmosphere and color scheme of the Sha theme, it is nonetheless beautiful and by far my favorite expansions when it comes to visual design. Timeless Isle is great, I especially like the The Celestial court. The Dread Isle, sometimes referred to as Isle of Thunder, is also visually great, for what it's meant to represent. And pinnacle of them all, the aforementioned Kun-Lai Summit. By far, my favorite zone in the whole game. Stunningly beautiful, MSV is a great raid (visually, as I haven't played during MoP to judge the gameplay), the whole feel to it is simply amazing. I seriously hope Blizzard revisits Pandaria for a future expansion, removes the Sha ooze, and makes Pandaria a sunny place brimming with life (only to face yet another conflict). Maybe even update textures and terrain, as it has been almost 7 years since MoP first came out (though compared to some other regions in the game, it is pretty far ahead), and include one of those flashback NPCs to allow you to visit the pre-revamp Pandaria. I haven't thought much about the story, nor how would it all play out, but just a small hope from someone who really enjoys Pandaria and content it has to offer (to farm at least).

I think it's probably the region with most potential both from a visual design perspective, and cultural story-telling, and there are many things Blizzard can do to make Pandaria even more awesome in all regards.",A tiny fragment of hope inside me regarding a future expansion somewhere down the line,1

just NO.  if we are going to have a ""pet"" please dont let the hunters boar look more powerful than my ugly summon.  let us have a valkyrie instead as our summon.  Anything than this ghoul.  Give us a skeleton that we can visually gear with friggen heavy armor and my artifact skin or something.  Anything.

Its bad enough my dps comes from giving you zits and then popping them while I blow snot at you.

Is it best to sim those 2 traits, then sim the traits from the third ring, then sim any other non Azerite gear swaps you might do once you’ve established what traits you should be using?

291,"Disclaimer: I never played WoW but I may be considering it should SWTOR 6.0 fail to deliver. However, I understand that any comparisons of group content difficulty between the two games won't be perfect, if only because they require different numbers of people to run. That said, it should be taken with a grain of salt.

Maybe someone that played both games recently can chime in on my preliminary impressions:

SWTOR flashpoints vs WoW dungeons: here I exclude story mode FPs because they are solo content. Also all of the SWTOR group content can be considered current, unlike WoW, with bolster giving players not at max level the stats of a max-level player in entry-level gear at max level, in both SM ops and FPs, but not the abilities.

VM FPs can feel anywhere between normal and heroic dungeons, depending mostly on how old the FP is, if you have a reasonably-leveled team of 4. Usually the older, the easier. That said, without the trinity, and especially without a healer, the difficulty can ramp up, and also having lowbies on hand.

MM FPs overlap somewhat in difficulty with VMs, so they can feel anywhere between heroic and mythic dungeons. The newest ones could feel like one was running a M+, albeit untimed.

Now, on to operations vs raids. Yes, SM ops are readily puggable, except for the latest, but it's not so easy that you can have 8 monkeys slapping keyboards, or have half a team be AFK, and still clear them. In that sense, I could compare those to normal raids.

HM operations have added mechanics, and they are, except for the oldest two (which are mechanically identical to their SM versions, just with stuff having more HP and hitting harder), almost never pugged. They usually require a guild and voice comms to clear and, as such, would be closer to heroic raids than normal raids.

NiM ops require 8 (or 16, but very few guilds can even have 16 players capable of running ops at that level) players to play perfectly. I believe that NiM can be compared to mythic raids.",WoW vs SWTOR: group content difficulty,1

318,"I saw another post earlier about the exorbitant cost of faction mounts and how gold is much harder to come by these days. 

I wanted to offer my sort of quick gold making tips that do not take too much time and effort. These will not make you a gazllionaire, but will give you a decent living and the ability to buy some of these 72k faction mounts if you really want them. 

I didn't come up with this. Many people do it. Many have a multiple-toon system going, but this only requires one toon and two professions. 

I chose enchanting and tailoring. Level them both to max and do whatever quests there are at the end, but especially for enchanting so you can get the extra mats from disenchanting. There are guides on the internet for how to do this quickly and it doesn't take much gold to power level them, especially tailoring. 

There are two ways I make money at this point with these two professions. One is just crafting Tidespray Linen Bracers when tidespray linen is very cheap and then disenchanting them. Then I just sell the mats straight out to the auction house. 

The other thing is to make enchants when they are profitable. The best of these are Force Multiplier, Accord of Haste, and Accord of Mastery. The enchants are slower sellers and the prices fluctuate, but they still turn a good profit as long as you don't flood the auction house with them. Most people know this, so there won't be like 10 pages of enchants. 

To give you an example of the little time required, I usually spend about 10 minutes per day doing this and I make about 10-20k per day, depending on the day of the week. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are hot days. That's not alot but this is only 10 minutes' worth of doing almost nothing. 

Just this morning I logged on and bought tidespray linen, six stacks of 200, for a total of about 2000 gold (maybe a little less). With the enchants I was able to make from the veiled crystals and just selling the rest of the mats straight out, I should get a total of close to 10k. That's it. There is the chance I will have to repost the enchants but they eventually sell.

But to do that, that just required me going to the auction house, buying some mats, crafting them, disenchanting them, and posting nearly all of the mats except for the few I used for enchants. You'll get a few veiled crystals for your work. If you do the world quests or any other activities, you may get a few more veiled crystals out of that. 

This is not rocket science or some trade secret. I just wanted to share it with some people who might need quick cash. It's a steady income and 10-15k per days is not bad. 

I will note that when most people have done the current raid content, this might dip a little bit but by that time you've already made a decent bit of cash and can get by until the next raids. And if enchants aren't selling well, just sell the mats or hold them until new raid content comes out.",Some quick gold making tips for those hurting for cash but don't want to spend all day at the auction house.,1

However that is not true considering that green Orcs are made up of the same clans Mag'har Orcs are. They are just from different timelines.

341,"Edit: This is possibly the most downvoted post I've ever made in my years of reddit. I'm just asking an opinion. The WoW subreddit has been particularly egregious for this. If you don't like classic, guess what: that's 100% completely and utterly fine by me. Furthermore, I don't think that classic is 100% better in every way shape or form - it's not better in most ways and I'll be playing it less than the original. I use the term ""**weirdly** excited"" like, the term ""weird"" meaning ""unexpected"", ""you know, classic was really barebones and basic and kind of a pain in the ass, but I liked a lot of aspects of it.""

I'd really appreciate it if each and every person who downvoted took the time to tell me why this post is so terrible in as constructive of a way as possible.

At least then I'd understand the backlash. I honestly thought I was posting a very, very casual, neutral post.

----

OP:

I think the game was better then in a lot of ways.

You had to really rely on people. Doing dungeons was fun because it was challenging and it was harder to get people to do it.

Quests were dotted around the world and often times they felt very arbitrary, but in a good way. It felt like you're just wandering along to go help people in this village, instead of ""YOU are the EPIC HERO coming into COMPLETE EPIC QUESTS with orders DIRECTLY from the LEADER of your FACTION!""

Like, I loved just being ""some character."" I loved the gradual progression from greens to blues, and from blues to epics.

I like my graphics either to be hyper-realistic or stylized with whatever detail level. I kind of like older graphics because they sort of force you to use your imagination - and they look more surreal in a way.

I also like that classes weren't overbalanced. You could pick a class that was genuinely overpowered and kick some ass.

And specialization truly mattered. I liked when you level up, and then you get a talent point and it adds something.

I dunno, I'm excited.

Edit: I also loved stance dancing with warriors, and other mechanics that let you get trickier with your class. I feel like classes now feel the same. ""Here's your AoE that emanates from you, here's your distance AoE, here's your 4-6 second single target stun."" It's like there's a list of standard abilities that are just renamed and slightly different on each class now, and the active management for most classes is the cooldown of your normal abilities.",Anyone Else Feel Weirdly Excited for Classic?,1
342,"Hi all - I've played World of Warcraft for 15 years, but I've always stuck to a pretty basic rotation of addons. Recently, my fiancee has hopped into Warcraft and is loving it - but it's her first-ever computer game and she's struggling with it quite a bit.

I wanted to see if the sub could recommend me any easier quality-of-life additions I can make that would help her quest, read the map, or do pretty much anything else that a first-time gamer may be struggling with.

So far, I've added the following that seem to be helping:

* **Bagnon** to give her a single bag.
* **Scrap** to help her at vendors.
* **GTFO** to yell at her when she's standing in poo.
* **OmniCC** \- The countdown timers on this are easier for her to understand/read.

345,"I don't know how to call it exactly so I'll try my best to explain what I mean:

Right now if you start a lvl 1 character ALL the xpacs are available, sure some are blocked behind level barriers but for a lvl 1 toon, adult anduin is king in stormwind, darkshore is affected by cata, etc etc, but then when you hit lvl 60 and higher it takes you to all the past xpacs and expects you to be able to follow it. Its all just a muddled mess and to a new player it must be so goddamn confusing. I for example stopped playing during wotlk and only returned a few months ago, and was completely lost.

Why isn't it a thing that the world changes and xpacs are added to your game as you, maybe like, accept the quest that starts the xpac? It takes away all of the immersion when you're chasing teen anduin on pandaria at the orders of king varian, then you take a quick trip to stormwind to do something in the auction house and suddenly anduin is an adult and the king and varian is dead.


Idk if it's just me or anyone else finds issue with this. I'm a weird person, I have to have everything in order without any interceptions otherwise I have a really hard time enjoying the thing. Especially since I'm trying to catch up on lore, it's so hard to do.


In my ideal version of the game it would look something like this:

The world doesnt phase according to the latest released xpac, but to the latest xpac you started a quest for (note: if you, for example, accept the quests to start both mop and cata at the same time the world phases according to mop since it was released later).

When you start a level 1 you get classic zones, no more cata affected zones. World basically looks like it did in vanilla.
Then for every xpac you start the world changes to look like it did when that xpac was released. It only changes again once you start the questline of the next xpac, and so on.","Why isn't ""expansion toggling"" a thing?",1

348,"Greetings

My apologies if this has been brought up already, my search hasn't turned up anything related.

While playing my Mag'har Orc hunter, I noticed weird behaviour of the ""Open Skies"" racial together with other buffs that increase mounted speed.

Now this is just an assuption, but I think the buff was coded differently to make it less useless, allowing it to stack with buffs that ordinarily wouldn't stack with anything else (mainly the ""Mount up"" guild perk).

However this different coding apparently allows the racial to activate mount speed buffs in situations when they shouldn't be active. This has become apparent since 8.2 and flying in BFA zones.

On any non Mag'har character I tried, neither the ""Pathfinder Part 1"" nor the ""Swift Landing"" 20% buffs apply to flying mounts, only to ground mounts. On my Mag'har, these DO apply.

For comparison:

**Non Mag'har**

Ground (assuming journeyman (100%) riding):

* Base: 200%

* Mount up: 210% (doesn't stack with anything else)

* Pathfinder 1: 220%

* Swift Landing: 220%

* Pathfinder 1 + Swift Landing: 240%

* Deathknight/Paladin: 220%

* Deathknight/Paladin + Pathfinder 1/Swift Landing: 240%

* Deathknight/Paladin + Pathfinder 1 + Swift Landing: 260%


Air (assuming master (310%) riding):

* Base: 410%

* Mount up: 420%

* Pathfinder 1: 410% (no effect)

* Swift Landing: 410% (no effect)

* Deathknight/Paladin: 430%

**Mag'har**

Ground (assuming journeyman (100%) riding):

* Base: 210%

* Mount up: 220% (actually stacks with Open Skies)

* Pathfinder 1: 230%

* Swift Landing: 230%

* Pathfinder 1 + Swift Landing: 250%

Air (assuming master (310%) riding):

* Base: 420%

* Mount up: 430%

* Pathfinder 1: 440%

* Pathfinder 1 + Swift Landing: 460%

Now I get these numbers from an addon (the ""Speed"" module of [Broker everything](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/broker-everything)), and I can't be 100% sure they are correct. However the Addon has proven to be accurate in the past (for example when they broke the druid swift flight form towards the end (?) of legion, it was immediately visible) and I have no reason to doubt it.

I'd be very interested if anyone could either confirm or refute these observations. I also did not test it with the ""Monel-Hardened Hoofplates"" buff active.",Open Skies (Mag'har Orc racial) interacting weirdly with other mount speed buffs,1

I was playing WoW last night in Nazjatar repeatedly killing the Packmother for the chance of the second rare spawn towards my achievement. The fathom meat WQ popped up and briefly after I was disconnected to find that my account had been banned. Of note, the only addons I had at all were recount, DBM, and TomTom. I have never purchased gold or services from a source like wowvender and I have never shared my account with anyone. This was the email I received:
""**NOTICE OF ACCOUNT CLOSURE***

I have never used cheats or bots, and am barely capable of installing basic addons into the game on my mac to begin with. Obviously with this news I petitioned it through the online customer service. I changed the email address associated, my password, and added the authenticator and notified Blizzard that I believe a third party had somehow intervened if they actually found evidence of cheating. They revised the ban to a suspension which read:

""Action(s) Taken:
Account Suspended
Violation: Cheating

Your fellow players reported you for cheating. This includes actions like botting, and exploiting game mechanics.

After a thorough investigation of the evidence, we have Suspended your World of Warcraft account.
As the owner of this account, you are responsible for all actions associated with it. We will only overturn penalties if there is evidence of a compromised account or similar extenuating circumstances. ""

So now I have 180 days ban on an account that has been active since classic without a single hiccup. Today I chatted with a representative (who I changed to “Anon GM” below) to try to gain clarity:

""You are now chatting with Anon GM.
Anon GM:
Salutations! This is Game Master Anon GM, at your service. How are you doing today? 

You:
not too good honestly 

Anon GM:
Sorry to hear that! How can I help you today?

You:
I am trying to obtain clarification about an account suspension I have received. I have read all of the the official rules that could lead to a suspension and do not believe to be in violation of any of them 

Anon GM:
I see. When it comes to suspensions, we're typically not able to provide much more information that has already been sent, but let me take a look into the account for you.

You:
I would appreciate that. It was initially a perma-ban which caught me off guard completely. At the time it happened I was spamming Packmother NPC in Nazjatar in hopes that killing would spawn the rare father mob. A world quest popped up to kill fathoms and I started tagging what i could with my unholy plague since these monsters can also rarely drop reputation/follower xp turn-ins. I was abruptly disconnected shortly into this to find a ban. I did hurt my back a couple days ago and have been playing excessively, i must admit so i thought maybe they thought I was botting or something and that is why I was reported. I am just upset because no one has been able to help me and I 100% believe I am innocent in this case 

Anon GM:
All right, thanks so much for your patience. I looked over everything here again, and I'm afraid our decision still stands. We will not be able to overturn the suspension, and you will need to wait for it to expire naturally before have access to the account.

You:
is there anyway to contact someone higher up or something?. Quite frankly this is ridiculous that no one can even tell me why this has occurred 

Anon GM:
You should have received an email with the information regarding the suspension. We are not able to go into further details than that.
You:
it says for ""unauthorized cheat programs,"" which I would not even know how to obtain. I feel like the computer algorithim looking for botting tagged me because I was performing such a monotonous loop trying to kill the last 2 rares for my achievement 

Anon GM:
Right. It was suspended for unauthorized third-party programs, and that's all the specifics I'll be able to get into. I can tell you that this was reviewed multiple times, and we will be upholding the penalty.

You:
I was seriously using DBM, recount, and tomtom which are all highly used addons. If anything else was running it was without my knowledge or consent and they are already deleted. I genuinely do not understand the lack of transparency 

Anon GM:
When it comes to these actions, we are not able to get into details or specifics because we're not able to reveal our investigation methods.

You:
well the methods clearly are not working. I love playing this game and I believe in keeping its integrity. Thats what makes it so fun. You are taking that away from people with no justification whatsoever. Im not trying to learn Blizzard's secrets but there is an obvious problem associated with this 

Anon GM:
I'm sorry that I'm not able to go into more details, but this has been reviewed and the decision must stand. If there is anything else I can take a look into, I'd be happy to do so, but we've given all the information we're able to on this.

You:
why is it such a long ban given the circumstances? in 6 months time you are not going to have a customer in me at all anymore 

Anon GM:
The suspension is based on the severity of the violation, and we take these types of actions very seriously.
You:
The severity? i dont even know what that means from what ive been told. 
Anon GM:
The unauthorized use of third-party programs in this case.
You:
and yet you cant tell me what supposed program this was or what it was doing that constitutes a violation? 

Anon GM:
No, I am not.

You:
Do you understand how messed up this is? You have the power to just destroy thousands of hours of work without giving any sort of explanation. Ive done my research online and Im not the only person having this issue. There is no point in having ""customer support"" if the customer has no rights to begin with. I get that people that do genuinely cheat would make claims that they are innocent as well but where is the process for us to be heard in order to weed out those unjustly accused? 

Anon GM:
This is the process, and you've gone through it. We've reviewed this, and we must uphold this action. At this point, since we've discussed everything we can about this action, if you do not have any other issues that are not related to this, I must be closing the chat and moving on.

You:
Well thanks for absolutely nothing.""

Had a very hard time keeping my cool. Was warned in the closed ticket for harassing the GM and threatened with a full ban.

My question is, does anyone have any advice on what to do? If I make another account (which I really don’t want to do) will it be able to be merged once my account ban goes away? Is there a way to go over the head of a GM to put something into action? I am more than frustrated right now.

I aim to use the achievements as my guide, which is largely my reason for starting a new account. It's a little bit of a pain in the ass to figure out which achievements you've completed on the character you're on through the UI. With a new account, it's either complete or it's not. I figure most, if not all, relevant content has an achievement attached to it  


I will be using a 110 boosted Paladin to do this. The boost will make it easier to get through content I've already been through a bunch of times. I chose a Paladin because they (by my quick assumption) will be capable of picking up the most legendary weapons along the journey. A pleasant surprise I've already found after going through a handful of starter zones is that I'm halfway to 111 through questing and pet battles.

The idea is that I will not move to the next expansion until ALL content has been completed on my current expansion. And here's especially where I could use a little advice -- I'm planning on completing the following criteria before checking an expansion off as completed:  


\-All quests completed  
\-All dungeons &amp; raids completed    
\-All reputations to Exalted  
\-All zones discovered  
\-All legendary weapons and items obtained  
\-All gear sets obtained (including dungeon gear sets)  
\-All pets obtained and pet masters defeated  
\-All mounts obtained (this one is iffy due to drop rates)  
\-Enchanting, Blacksmithing, Cooking, Fishing, and Archaeology to max level with all patterns/recipes  
\-All relevant profession achievements completed (fish up Old Crafty, etc)  


PvP will be difficult, because I'm not sure you can grind for individual battlegrounds (was never much of a PvPer), but I do plan on maxing the reputation with Frostwolf, Warsong, etc. There also might be a way to do that outside of PvP. I will need to do some research.  


Can you guys think of any other criteria? What would you consider completing?  


Why am I doing this? Because I am a bit of a completionist. I've swapped mains more than once in every expansion, and I like the idea of playing a character that has completed everything solidly throughout the game. I have a guild mate who has done this, and I kind of admire that. I was also a hardcore raider through most of the expansions, and that really effected the way that I enjoyed (or didn't, for that matter) the rest of the game.

426,"Hi, everyone!

[Wipefest](https://www.wipefest.net) has full support for every boss in The Eternal Palace, so get your logs loaded up and see where you can improve for your next raid!

Every boss also has percentiles configured for their insights, meaning you can see how well you're performing on particular mechanics compared to other raid teams. The percentiles work in the same fashion as Warcraft Logs. A value of *75* means you performed better than *75%* of kills on that mechanic.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sc6en6ptppb31.png

&amp;#x200B;

These percentiles provide better context to the insights, and will hopefully help people quickly see which mechanics they need to focus on more if they want to progress quicker.

There's also a [dedicated statistics page](https://www.wipefest.net/statistics) that will showcase top-ranking logs for each boss on different mechanics.

For example, let's say your guild is progressing Mythic Abyssal Commander Sivara and getting a low percentile on number of Unstable Mixture explosions. You can visit [the statistics page for that boss](https://www.wipefest.net/statistics/abyssal-commander-sivara), and see the top-ranking logs for that mechanic:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xt6eydivppb31.png

&amp;#x200B;

You can then go to one of the top logs and try to work out what their tactic is. One of the insights will show you when players are resetting their debuffs, and how many stacks they had when they reset:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/gqdmzzgwppb31.png

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you were resetting too often, or you were gaining too many extra stacks from other sources. Hopefully, this kind of information can help you improve your tactics for your next pull!

I've also added a small feature to let you filter the timeline to events related to a particular insight, for example:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/66w6e8dxppb31.png

&amp;#x200B;

Clicking on that will filter the timeline to the following:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xon80n9yppb31.png

&amp;#x200B;

And clicking it again will reset the timeline to its default:

A guide for using Wipefest and optionally setting up the bot can be [found on Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/how-to-use-wipefest).

Got any suggestions or questions? Feel free to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/QhE4hfS)!

Over the past 6 months, I've been working hard on a major feature: multi-pull analysis. This will let you analyse an entire night of fights at once, and provide aggregated insights so that you can see how well you're performing in total, as well as letting you know how your percentiles changed (hopefully improved) from fight to fight as the night progressed. This feature is currently in *beta*, and is available to people that subscribe on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/wipefest) (trying to cover server costs). I'll probably do a bigger post about it when it's a bit more fleshed out, but here's a few quick screenshots:

&amp;#x200B;

To keep things short, after playing only dps (could say from TBC - BFA, with skipping Cata), I have decided that i want a ""Fresh start"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I want to switch over to the ""Tank side of PVE"".

I know there are a lot of guides and overall information about Tanks and how to Tank WoW content,

but I was just wondering, if maybe any of you have some advice, information or anything in regards of Tank\`ing.

&amp;#x200B;

I\`m kinda bored of dps\`s classes and have been more and more interested in Tanks.

For now, I was thinking to start with Paladin. And the main goal is to Tank Mythic+ (10-15) and some Raid content. Just a note - I have almost no previous experience with Tanking.

&amp;#x200B;

So, in conclusion, i have some questions in my head, like -

&amp;#x200B;

Where do Tanks rank in the ""How difficult"" the class is ? 

Is Paladin a safe pick for my goals and a new start ? (Monk sounds hard, War is also a choice, don\`t know anything about the other classes) 

Are there some new Tank player mistakes that should be avoided ?

How do Tanks do with solo content , when needed to do Scenario, World quest and so on ? ( I mean, gear , talents , and do they possibly switch to a dps spec ? )

440,"Hello,  
I have only played WoW for a short time. I think around a half year around the WOTLK Expansion.   
I really liked the DK Design so...that was my hook to buy the game. \^\^  


I play some other MMOs over the years, but everytime I hear people talk about WoW, they say that the game is extremly toxic and was always super toxic.   
And when I compare it with the picture of me and some of my friends who played back then, it does not really fit.  
It also does not fit with the ex-WoW players I met in other MMOs.   
They were friendly, played with the group and did not do things like Raid hoping just for the hope of being one evening faster with the Raid progress.  
Of course, there were some people who wanted to rush literally everything and never explained anything in WoW.   
There were people who were idiots and behaved like children. But I never experienced it as extremly toxic.  
I met nice people in that time. I even played a bit together with a really nice Raid Group I found.  


Several MMO communities also blame the WoW players for every kind of toxicity in their own communities.  
Did the community really change in all those years or is the whole toxicity thing more like a wild rumor, that several MMO communities throw around to make their community look nicer?  
I mean, I can't really believe all those wild WoW refugee rumors, because they sound so over the top.   
They make is sound, like a bunch of ex-WoW players would ruin whole games.  
Toxicity will always be there, but those communities make it look like everybody in WoW is so toxic like the most toxic Overwatch players. (which were the reason why I quit that game. There was a day, when the shouting, screaming and blaming each other crushed all my fun with the game)  


It would be really interessting to hear how people who played those game  for all the time feel about the community. Have they have changed or are the things told in other communities are really just strawman to scare the people.  
Were people nicer back then?   
Is there a difference in certain countries or continents?   
Had the Dutyfinder implementation any impact?   
I hear that sometimes, that people were extremly friendly around that time, but I did not play in the vanilla times, so I have no memories of that time to compare.

my main is mage and I play WoW from Vanilla. I raided from TBC to MoP (in R1 guild on realm) where I stopped due the little time I had. Then I played WoW many years as casual, always puging, or doing some dungs and raids with friends I made in old guild. But Method with their stream hyped me so much that after 7 years I started to raid again in mythic guild. It is so much fun. I had to find a guild, where I met some new great dudes and grills. When I was casualing I couldnt play 1 char coz I found that so boring very fast. But thanks to mythic raiding I found to love my main char again, where I see that every progress to your character matter (mana pearl, AP, essences).

470,"Hi, I started working on this game a few weeks ago. I had to rip the sound files from WoW, find the boss quotes online, do a little data entry for each boss, and tie it all together.

The rules: Obviously no googling. You are provided with multiple quotes in both text and audio format. You must use the text or audio quotes to determine which boss utters the quotes. You can select a boss after selecting a content, such as Classic or Battle for Azeroth, then selecting a location, such as Molten Core or Naxxramas, and finally by choosing the boss and clicking confirm.

Info: The current difficulty, Apprentice, has 30 preset bosses. Your score will appear in a mini popup after completing all 30 rounds. To skip a boss, just select any boss at random and confirm it. I haven't focused on aesthetics so the website is very bare-bones.

493,"So im updating my macros for my Discipline priest.

Currently I decided to make convoluted macros with conditional targeting to aide in automated targeting.

The one roadblock macro I thought that would've been very simple to write, but yet it doesn't.

&amp;#x200B;

     #showtooltip
    /cast [@target,harm] [@mouseover,harm] [@mouseovertarget,harm] Dispel Magic; [@player] Arcane Torrent

I previously had my Dispel magic, and Purify coupled together, but I ran into a few issues, so decided to separate them. And in separating them I decided to couple Dispel Magic with Arcane Torrent.

My thought process is that it will prioritize my current target &gt; mouseovered unit &gt; mouseovered unit's target. So if Im healing and have my cursor on say my MT, that isn't definitely targeting the same target that I want to dispel, It will prioritize that if I didnt target the unit specifically, or mouseover it either. However if I dont have a enemy target / mouseovered / MO'd target then it will cast Arcane torrent.

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote my other macro with the secondary spell having the modifier with \[help\] instead of \[harm\], and the two spells coupled pretty much as I anticipated.

My running theory is that since Arcane Torrent doesn't have a targeting variable, that it is polarizing where its either castable or its not, and succeeds targeting modifiers.

edit: I know this post is probably dead but I just wanted to add, articles like this kind of show why I feel like its wrong [http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/692008/Gaming/InGame+Currency+Triggers+State+Gambling+Laws+Rendering+Mobile+Game+Illegal+Gambling](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/692008/Gaming/InGame+Currency+Triggers+State+Gambling+Laws+Rendering+Mobile+Game+Illegal+Gambling) . In this article there was a casino app that used ingame 'chips' that you had to purchase with real money. There was no way to cash out with this game though, so you paid to play, but you couldnt really win anything other than more plays. And there was a way to trade chips between players, creating a very easy scenario to pay for chips, then trade a player and do a real-world outside-of-game trade as well. This model, having a game where you cannot play unless you pay, where you cannot cash our your 'ingame currency' as money but you CAN buy MORE 'playtime' or more currency with it (that is also sold for usd), and then having it all linked to a game of chance like casino games. This is basically what WoW is doing.. I have to pay a subscribtion (aka spend real life money of something equalish to a WoW Token, 30days of playtime) which I can then pay as much as id like to buy MORE WoW Tokens, getting me ingame currency for money, which I cannot directly cash out but I can use to gamble with and then trade with other players for real life stuff if I so choose.

I think there is a legit lawsuit able to be made with this /shrug. People forget gambling is kind of shifty business. It's kind of scummy - the people hosting are guaranteed to win money and the majority of people playing are guaranteed to lose. It's not a risk for the people hosting. Which is why there are such strict laws in the real world for gambling, too. In some places it is illegal to gamble outside of casinos period. If you try and set up your own casino without registering with the government and making sure they get their cut (because the gov knows the game, its GUARANTEED money for you, NO risk) they will shut you down. It's not like operating a normal business that sells a product or has a chance to fail. It is its own thing. There is absolutely some type of 'gambling ring' going around in WoW using In-game currency, which is able to be bought with real money and traded with other players in the game, and is 'required' to play the game (payment for time, which can also translate to ingame currency, and be bought with ingame currency). Some might not see it as a 'gambling ring' but you gotta think, its 20$usd for 130k in game atm.. i've seen people gambling that in one go. its like real casinos, not everyone is just playing around with spare change. people have problems with this stuff. i dunno.",Why are in-game casinos allowed?,1

Some time ago Activision began a ""budget-cutting campaign"" in order to maximize the profit from the game. They let go of a lot of people, and began creating more store mounts, etc.. Ya'll know the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as a reminder, I'm trying to be constructive here. If you got any more suggestions or would like to talk about my points, feel free to start a conversation, I'd be happy to talk. I'll have the TLDR-s of each points at the end of said points.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Make zones that don't die after one patch(examples of zones which died as soon as a new patch has landed: Broken Shore, Argus, for the most part Broken Isles, for the most part Zandalar and Kul'Tiras, and the next on the table are: Nazjatar and Mechagon).** To elaborate, let's take the Classic zones as an example: No new zone were added with each patch, we could only visit the ones that existed since 1.0. filled with all kinds of important resources, and quests. The pace of the game was overall slower, and there were always a lot of people leveling, so there was always low lvl worldpvp action going on. The higher level zones were locked down because their resources lasted till the end of the game, meaning that every zone was always being trespassed by a lot of people. (Edit: I missed to mention that new raids with each major patch also took place in the zones that were present since 1.0, which if we compare to modern times, they pretty much always come up with a new place for the next raid.)  ***This removes the need to constantly make new zones, creatures and resources for the players in each patch, while still keeping the World alive.***

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Remove LFR, remove Mythic difficulties, remove World Quests**. Now this might be quite the controversial given how easy the game is unless you overkill the difficulty, but that would be exactly my point. By removing these two difficulties you will have to make Normal mode at least intermediate difficulty (in 5 mans, in raids make them challenging but not too hard), while Heroic mode should be very challenging (to get an idea of it: for 5 mans, Burning Crusade HC or Cataclysm pre-nerf HC difficulty, as for raids, make them extremely unforgiving). As for World Quests, it ties in with my first point mostly, but also with this one. For my first point, it would remove ""the need"" for people to visit certain zones, thus making go out to the world YOUR decision, as for my second, the current System of reputation grinding would be deleted (and returning to the old Tabard System), alongside having to make new gear and items for each new World Quest (with each new zone added to the game / patch). ***This removes the need to constantly come up with FOUR different versions of fights in dungeons / raids, and for having to come up with FOUR different sets of gear each time. This also enhances game balance, because removing Raid Finder also means removing a way to get easy Access to raid gear (sets and trinkets for the most part) , improving PvP and PvE balance at the same time, and also reintroducing an easier way to farm reputation without having to come up with a lot of World quests, and without timegating everything.***

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Make the balance a bit more wild.** Now what I mean with this, is right now, Blizzard is trying to accomplish a ""hyper balance"" System, similar to FPS games. Now, the problem with this in an RPG is that it removes uniqueness, which is essentially what an RPG's gameplay elements relies on. Paladins were the best healers with a lot of defensive cooldowns, Druids were the best Hybrid in the game, Rogue being insane in single target and in PvP, Mages the powerful casters with little HP but a lot of utility, and so on. Now, if you compare that to current, there are barely any differences you can make between the roles of each class, or how they perform. Now this might sound dumb so far, but here's the catch. Current classes are tweaked pretty much every day to achieve that hyper balance (alongside a lot of PvE items), whereas the older classes (even during the wotlk times) weren't tweaked every day, because they were good at the role they filled in, and players knew it. As a sub rogue, you were strong in duels but you were weak in AoE fights. As a holy paladin, you were the best single target healer, but you were bad at AoE healing (and the fact that you had 0 HoTs). ***This removes the need to constantly tweak the classes, because some numbers say so. This also brings back a major RPG element into the game, which makes everything more fun.***

&amp;#x200B;

**- Remove Warmode, reduce the amount of phasing quests and zones, remove sharding from populated servers, merge the less populated ones.** Oh my god the servers are so pressured right now that you cant even have 80 people at the same place WPvPing, because the servers will die. Ever since BfA came out the servers have been much more laggier, simply because the game DOUBLED the amount of phasing and crap going on with Warmode. So removing that would help a lot. Also, reducing the amount of phasing quests and zones would also mean less worktime spent on doing it, and also making your servers less laggy, and making everything less confusing. Removing sharding would also help a lot, not just with reinforcing the MMO identity of the game, but also removing lagg. Of course this would also mean the reintroduction of PvE, PvP and RPPVP servers. ***This would make the servers more stable, while also reducing the amount of work needed when creating new content. This also makes everything less confusing and also reintroduces a long missed element of the game - which was destroyed with Sharding.***

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Stop adding new crazy Systems to your game that you are going to throw away after one expansion (Artifacts, extra Artifact traits, Azerite, extra Azerite neck powers).** It's just dumb and it fucks up balance, alongside your salary. Instead, we could see the reintroduction of the tier sets, similar to Classic style - the set favors one spec of your class. Why just one? Balancing issues, and a degree of uniqueness. You could also make professions matter again in the first place. ***This removes Systems that only last for the expansion they're present in, while re-introducing the ""infinite"" elements of the game.***",How to cut costs properly,1

623,"After coming back from years away from Azeroth, I can’t help but notice how sanitized PVP has become. The game does seem less exciting, and more “safe,” and not in a good way. Players tend to ignore each other more during random encounters, which is a bit dry, and Azeroth has lost an element of excitement.


You remember the recent game trailer where Sylvannas screams, “For the HORDE!” That part gave me the chills. That is exactly how it felt when you were able to truly impact the state of being in Azeroth during World PVP encounters. We shouted at the enemy, called out to each other, worked together and fought. It was all of US who were at the head of those battles. It was us who affected the outcome, and they really happened in these legendary places in Azeroth.

I remember huge horde numbers running up the hill toward the entrance of Ironforge back in the day. People would cry for help, hit heir guild up for backup, etc. It was unpredictable and exciting.


The first time I encountered a horde player, I saw a druid in cat form being chased by two alliance players out of a heavy alliance region. I felt vulnerable because of my low level, but excited to help them run this druid down. He still got away.


“A Tauren shaman just rode passed me! Watch out!” I can remember days spent questing in Darkshore. It was like the boogeyman was creeping through the forest when you’d see that. Sometimes they would show mercy, and would just be scouting. The randomness and excitement of it all always created a buzz in the area. Sometimes causing high level alliance players to show up and defend the towns.


Southshore battles were insane. There were no rigid battleground rules that kept the fight “sanitized.” The entire town would sometimes end up annihilated. When I was a low level, I would watch in awe as these huge fights would break out. I wasn’t bothered that my questing was interrupted. THIS put the WAR in Warcraft, and even at 20 levels lower than the enemy, I would do what I could do help the fight.


The players are what make this game exciting. At any moment, in any area of Azeroth, a skirmish could break out. High levels would assist the low levels, and you’d meet new players through these encounters. The talented and clever fighters would usually build a reputation for themselves. It was a great time, guys. Sure, some people didn’t like getting ganked in STV. I got caught by the enemy plenty of times. That’s the nature of war, though. It is in the name. It is up to you to do something about it. :wink:

644,"Before i say anything, please note that i wasn't playing a lot during legion, so most of my info on this is coming from WoWhead. Also, i had this thought in the last 10 minutes of school after a math test, and i was basically braindead. There is a good chance some of the things i bring up dont make sense or are just plain wrong, feel free to correct me if that's the case.

Obviously, it's too late to do that now, the Heart Forge system wasn't added until nearly a year after the expansion launched, and Shadow priests' weapon has already become a plot point, but lets imagine for a second that we had the Heart Forge since launch as a replacement to Artifact weapons.

After Sargeras plunged his sword into Azeroth, the players had to sacrifice their Artifact weapons to draw out the energy in the sword. While this is the logic for the removal of the Artifact system, and why artifact weapons are now just stat sticks to get you through Legion content, in 7.3.5 the artifacts were basically supercharged, gaining massive amounts of AP. 

Since a weapon full of demonic energy from a titan probably isn't the safest thing to carry around in battle, and the artifacts were already powerful items, they would have been perfect candidates as essences for the HoA. Something with the power of a High AP artifact weapon, plus the energies from Sargeras's sword would greatly empower the HoA. Since absorbing these things and empowering the Heart somehow helps heal Azeroth, it seems like the first thing to do after drawing out the Sword's power.

More importantly, it also would have been a perfect way to give classes their artifact abilities back. while a few artifact abilities are still in the game, its only about a third of them (11 in BFA out of the 36 from legion), and all of them are talents, with the exception of Unholy DKs' Apocalypse. Artifact weapons as essences would obviously have let players keep their main artifact ability as their major power, with some trait from them as a minor power.

What's more, every essence in the game drops a piece of vendor trash after being absorbed in the HoA, its power being drained. If artifact weapons were used as essences, they could drop their de-powered version after being absorbed, giving you back a stat stick until you get a better weapon. It probably would have felt better getting a reward for sacrificing the weapon you worked so hard to empower than just having it disappear and having to start over, even if they still removed the entire artifact system in 8.0 Hell, you could have even gotten extra starting AP for your heart based on your Weapon's AP when you sacrificed it.

Granted, their \*is\* the problem that the weapons you would be putting in the Heart of Azeroth is kinda full of energy from a giant demonic sword. Since the whole point of drawing the sword's power out was to prevent it from corrupting the planet, it may not be the best idea to put them into the literal HEART of Azeroth, but i'm sure they could come up with some sort of handwave for it. Maybe there's less demonic energy in the artifact than in the sword, maybe they leave the demonic energy in there and only absorb the artifact power.

TL;DR: If the Heart Forge system was around at BFA's launch, using Artifact weapons as essences would have been a perfect way to keep artifact abilities and maybe give a more satisfying end to the artifact system.",Artifact weapons would have worked perfectly as essences if the Heart Forge system was around at BFA's launch,1

Hi,

I  just wanted to have a reasonable conversation about this  topic. Please don't downvote me because you disagree, upvote me because you want to have a discussion. The Auction house. First things first. I loved auction housing.  Years ago before things like TSM came I had a blast at the action house.  I would find deals that worked wonders. I used to buy iron and then  sell it as steel for 5 times the profit. Only when people saw what was  happening did they also do the same. It felt so good to find a gap in  the market and take it in for myself. Wow auction house was full of  these opportunities that made it so fun to find and puzzle.

When  these addons came these things became more and more of a rarity and  auction housing became less of a puzzle to find great deals and profit  but became a monotonous chore of opening up using a program or  undercutting competitors. There is no more puzzling because everyone  knows exactly how much something is worth and it has come down to  essentially programs that scan the auction house for you and tell you  exactly where you can make money. Saying yes I would like to make money  on this instead of this is not manuel.

It  is boring and monotonous. I hear people defending it like everyone can  get it so its fair which is, to be frank, ridiculous. I shouldn't be  punished for deciding not to use an addon. Addons are about quality of  life boosts not flat out advantages. blurred line of how close you can  get to automatic before considering it being a bot. It isn't about being  fair. It is again about taking the fun out of the game for easy money  making at the expense of people who don't even know about addons for the  convenience of easy gold. I agree the auction house should be revamped  and I have no problem with things like auctioneer that do what the  auction house should already do. Like comparing prices without switching  tabs or seeing its current market value or posting what you want in an  easy fashion in a third of the time.

My  problem is more with TSM that scans the entire auction house for deals  and snipes. They take all the exploration of auction housing has been  taken out of auctioning and with it all the fun. Program finds the great  deals and programs tell us what item will make money. I don't have fun  auction housing anymore and us it only to sell things I find because  deals no longer exist. There is no spirit in finding the deal. Everyone  knows everything and people who make the wrong buyout price can pay for  it within seconds. Auction housing is a necessity and one that I don't  enjoy anymore.

This  may all sound melodramatic and to a certain extent it is. But it is  just another part of wow that has been going down hill and I wanted to  have a discussion about it and the wow forums are just people on both  sides calling the other stupid.

725,"I want to preface this by saying completely forget about exclusive raid traits and focus on how powerful gem sockets are, even post-nerf for many dps classes.

Feedback this week on benthic gear was the most discouraging thing I’ve seen in a while.

I would like to first point out that choosing and being able to control upgrades is a good thing with benthic gear. But they take a positive gear change and seemingly fumble it to further perpetuate the problems with stat scaling in this expansion and how it interacts with different ways to acquire in game rewards. I’ll elaborate. I will start with the feedback I’ve seen from the community.

Either the people are being disingenuous or very delusional when it comes to mentioning the positives of benthic gear involving ""choice"". For instance your character has 16 pieces of total gear. 12 that drops in m+ and 15 that drops in raid content. Blizzard now adds benthic gear. 4 slots of this benthic gear are BIS for raid with sockets. Even over 455 pieces. After getting these you only have 11 slots from the raid to gear up. In m+ the problem becomes worse in spite of the fact that raid traits only work in eternal palace, especially for classes that scale much better with secondary stats.

I’m currently in a situation where my 395 gloves with a socket are very close in value to 430 gear that is dropping in +10s due to insane secondary stat scaling from increasing Azerite powers. This is a heavy error in the design of the game. And the worst part is for this expansion it’s an ever increasing problem. As you get better Azerite armor the secondary stat problem gets much worse in this patch, and we are not even to the final raid yet. So it plays out like this. You get your BIS benthic for raid with sockets, upgrade to at least 420, spam m+ for upgrades on 8 pieces, until you realize you can also spam benthic for sockets on those other pieces and have the equivalent of 440-455 gear without sockets by not doing m+ content. That’s leaves only 6 slots that can be rewarding to receive in m+. Trinkets, rings, and weapons. And rings absolutely require sockets with how little secondary stat is added per 5 ilvl.

(Keep in mind that you are intentionally not leveling benthic to 425 in order to not waste manapearls to proc more slots with gems)

I'm sure there are more solutions to this problem, but the easiest one is to remove sockets from benthic gear. They should probably do this after the world first race is over, in order to not make top guilds quit the game who spammed countless alts to stack their gear. I'm pretty sure not every class needed to do this but it is a very big problem for classes that scale incredibly with secondary stats. The final patch will be a nightmare if gear keeps scaling with less and less secondary stats, turning 50 stat gems into +40 titanforges potentially. Right now rings are already in that spot.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A deeper point to this post is that this system you can look at as guaranteed socketed gear, which compared to mythic+ is hilariously more powerful unless relying on random titanforges and sockets on your items if you think that is dependable. The point I am making is that if you use the benthic system effectively, player motivation to do mythic + content and heroic raiding suffers specifically because of this system, and heroic was also suffering because of mythic+ already so this system just makes the problem worse.

weapons, rings, trinkets. This is what m+ provides rewards for without purely needing to pray for rng on titanforging or sockets.",Benthic gear nearly renders most heroic raiding and m+ rewards useless.,1

727,"I've been following updates on the beta and seeing what is available on forums and youtube. I played from Vanilla to MoP, and classic is looking pretty good (sad to say that 15 year old games are better than new ones) but the LAYERING issue has be extremely hesitant. If it goes through as an official feature for classic, I can affirmatively say I wont be playing it. 

Looking at what some suggestions or speculations options may be (such as mentioned in TipsOut video), there seems to be some clear winners and losers for ways to handle the launch population issues. 

1) For starters, the absolute wort option is constantly layering or sharding of the servers. The reason is that server community was THE reason you got addicted to WoW. The removal of server community is THE reason that so many people quit. WoW has recouped its losses in other ways by abusing whales and non-subscription sales, but the player pop has plummeted after many features were implemented like LFG. WoW was never a great game. It was, however, a great social platform. I.e. a single player classic, or even modern WoW, would be trash. But it was the bones that allowed the meat to stick together. The meat of the game was the players. The social aspect and how it reflected natural human tendencies into the digital world is what made it change gaming forever. Sharding/layering fractures this and is a huge no-go.

2) Server-1, Server-2, etc... basically make servers that are later merged. Not a great solution, but better than layering or sharding, as your experience at the moment is one cohesive world. I'd much rather have my group get merged with another as player pop dwindles than constantly have a server w/ no social structure from day 1. Some say there are downsides of merging, but none of the downsides are worse than sharding/layering, which destroy server culture and cohesiveness from day 1. 

3) Temporary sharding. This seems the best option. A few weeks, or longer if restricted to just low level zones, seems the best. Find a way to handle the large crowds on day 1 but that's it. Once you get out of lvl 20 or so zones, you can expect people to be the same people you see everyday. 

---

Is there more info on this? Over time it seems the devs have hinted at expanding sharding and layering, not reducing it. It's weird that after 15 years, server tech has gotten worse (ew, I had better world PVP 12 years ago than what I see people experience in BFA). Is this just Activation trying to cash grab real quick and we will never have proper social servers?",So is layering an official thing for WoW classic now?,1

778,"So I got the Aqueous Reliquaries necessary to make my Azerite Essence a few days ago.  I main tank for our raid team, but I wanted the DPS version of this essence for when I get to off spec in M+ runs.  In my excitement of getting enough of these, I clicked on it right away after raid was over.

I noticed the dialog box appear asking if I was sure I wanted to make this essence for my current specialization.  I hammered on NO since I was still in Protection specialization.  I then changed specialization to Fury and re-clicked the Reliquaries.  Again, get dialog asking if I wanted to make this for my current specialization.  Why, yes, I would love a really good DPS essence!

That's when I see that it became the tank essence.  My LOOT specialization was still set to protection, which I failed to notice or regard since the dialog stated current specialization (and didn't even show what that specialization was).

So I promptly put in a ticket and explained the steps like above and asked if I could get the reliquaries refunded to make the DPS one instead.

The response I got the following afternoon was...less than ideal.

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; This is &lt;GM#1 NAME REDACTED&gt; - thanks so much for taking the time to write to us about wanting to swap the Essence that your Warrior got for Protection instead of Fury. I am really sorry to hear that happened especially if you were saving them up from raiding. &gt;.&lt;

&gt;Up front, I don't have the best news to share. When the Aqueous Reliquary are combined a popup box shows up which asks the player:

&gt;""Are you sure you want to create an essence for your TANK/HEAL/DAMAGE specialization.""

&gt;Under this message there are YES and NO buttons and one of these have to be pushed in order to create the Essence. There is also a cast bar after this happens in order to let players cancel out of it if a mistake happened.

&gt;Digging through the game logs, I can see when your Warrior got enough Reliquary saved up to get the Essence and when they created it the loot specialization was set to Protection. Sadly, we aren't able to offer swapping this out for any other Essence or deleting it and giving back the currency because the game has done everything it was meant to do. When possible, best would be to double or triple check that you're in the correct loot specialization so that gear and item upgrades are funneled in for the specialization that you're wanting.

&gt;I know this isn't the answer you're looking for but I appreciate you taking the time to read my response. If you have any other questions or concerns, please let us know.

Frankly, I was kind of upset that I was being explained to like a child how a dialog box works, but I was further frustrated that the explanation was wrong.  I didn't respond very appropriately, that I will readily admit (SPOILER: and I do in a future ticket).  It was equally unprofessional for Customer Support to condescend to a customer/player like that I feel.

So I submitted a response marking the ticket as unresolved.

&gt;Marking this as not resolved since my ticket was read by someone with less than a 4th grade reading comprehension level.

&gt;The dialog clearly stated ""Current Spec"", as I detailed in my ticket.  Not current loot spec, or ""TANK/HEAL/DAMAGE"" as you so claim it does.

&gt;This places me at least a week behind now for my raid/M+ group content for something that could have been better detailed in the dialog.

&gt;I'm still not using the essence item to make this easier to swap around assuming this ticket reaches someone who actually cares even a little bit.

Now, after submitting this I figured the next response would not be favorable since I was a touch rude.  I did not however expect the Customer Support team to double down on the condescension and then add in a philosophy discussion.

&gt;Hey there! Game Master &lt;#2 NAME REDACTED&gt; here!

&gt;I've read your ticket about Aqueous Reliquaries! However, like Game Master &lt;#1 NAME REDACTED&gt; mentioned, if your loot spec was set to Protection, you would have been notified in two places.


&gt;First, the tooltip for the Reliquary would have said specifically that you'd be getting the Hardened Azerite Formation, and that the item created is based on your current loot specialization.

&gt;Second, the confirmation window would have said ""Are you sure you want to create an essence for your tank specialization?""


&gt;I've confirmed the wording in both places in-game, and I've also checked our Dev and QA records. There's no indication this confirmation window has changed or been clarified in any fashion since it was implemented.


&gt;We have no other reports from players that the confirmation window displayed the incorrect information, either.

&gt;With that information on hand, we can't determine if any kind of bug was in play. We have to assume that it did provide the correct information, and you'd simply made a mistake.

&gt;And that's fine - mistakes do happen. Sometimes they'll set you back in terms of Mythic progression. However, for a situation such as this, dealing with the consequences of mistakes and correcting them as best you can is an intended part of the game experience. It's rough, but that's part of the game. 

&gt;This is why we in Customer Support won't be able to switch out or swap that Reliquary for you. Players in other Mythic raids would be expected to handle any mistakes they make in a similar fashion.

&gt;If you'd like our stance on these kinds of subjects (or general Customer Service philosophy) to change for the future, you can always reach out to our developers through the Suggestion button here in-game, or through the General Discussion forums. But, our stance on this particular case for your Reliquaries won't be changing.

&gt;Still, I wish you the best of luck as you continue working through your Mythic kills.

&gt;Regards,

&gt;Game Master &lt;#2 NAME REDACTED&gt;

So now I'm getting told getting the wrong item by mistake is ""intended game design"" and somehow Mythic raiding got pulled into this.  Let me be clear, the only Mythic reference in any ticket to this point was M+.  Not Mythic raiding.

At this point, I'm really confused why so much effort is being expended by Customer Support to deny such a simple request that really shouldn't be much to ask for.  I've asked for something like this maybe 4 times in the past over the 13+ years I have been playing this game.  I've never seen this kind of attitude from Customer Support EVER before.

So, since things had not been resolved, I once again marked this as not resolved and submitted another response...

&gt;You are right.  Mistakes do happen.  That is indeed part of life and a great teacher.  

&gt;I just had hoped that my 15 years of being a customer for this game would have earned just a modicum of leeway and understanding when a mistake did happen.  Instead I've had to endure very condescending responses from the customer support team, which frankly I don't appreciate.

&gt;No where in my tickets did I say I was a Mythic raider.  So the fact you mention it numerous times in your response is moderately frustrating.  I think we both know that if a Mythic Raider in a top guild had made this mistake and got the wrong Essence, they'd just be benched from the roster.

&gt;While I may regret my rude remark about reading comprehension levels of the previous GM who responded to my original ticket, I cannot but now feel it is somewhat apt at this point.

&gt;If this whole scenario is part of ""intended game experience"", then I begin to question many things about this game and myself.

&gt;I can see that the Reliquary items in my bag do read loot spec.  I do however distinctly recall the dialog that popped up read ""current specialization"".  I asked a few other guild members and friends what their's said when they made their essences.  They recall the same as me.

&gt;Of course, we could all be mistaken.  Mistakes do happen.  

&gt;Over the years, I have only had to put in a few tickets for some mistakes or issues.  In the past the customer support team has been stellar and provided understanding and help.  This time around it has been nothing but condescending and uncaring in its responses.  I sincerely hope that isn't the intended customer support experience that the players are expected to have.

&gt;So again, I'm still not using this essence item in hopes that someone in the Customer Support team comes across this ticket that will actually read it this time.

Third time will surely be the charm, right?

&gt;Hi there, &lt;Melvalint&gt;,

&gt;This is Game Master &lt;#3 NAME REDACTED&gt; and I understand you're still hoping that someone will change the answer given to you regarding that azerite essence you received for your tank spec.  Thanks for reaching out to us about this.

&gt;Looking through everything once more, it appears that two previous GMs verified via logs that you were in Tank spec at the time this item was created.  One even went out of his way to check for any potential bugs with our QA and Dev teams and tested it out in-game, but was unable to find any issues with this item.

&gt;At this point, I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to give you a different answer than the one you have received.  We will not be able to swap out the essence for you.  

&gt;I know this wasn't the answer you were hoping for, but it does look like Game Master &lt;#2 NAME REDACTED&gt; summed up our policy on this accurately.  You can read this policy here: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10936.

&gt;I hope this helps to clear up any further questions you may have about this issue.  I will go ahead and close your ticket now.  If you have any other questions or concerns though, please feel free to let us know.

&gt;Warm Regards,

&gt;Game Master &lt;#3 NAME REDACTED&gt;

So even more surprised at this point that nothing is even remotely being done.  Just more ""log checking"" that confirms I was in Protection LOOT specialization.  Which while the cause of this ticket submission, was not the part that made me make the mistake.  Reading the dialog box, other guild members and myself recall it saying ""current specialization"".  These are 2 different things.  I did confirm the tooltip on the Reliquaries does indeed state for your current loot specialization, but it fails to state what it is currently.  That's fine.  My issue was the confirmation dialog box.

So once more into the breech...

&gt;Hi Game Master &lt;#3 NAME REDACTED&gt;,

&gt;I do appreciate that you at least read the ticket mostly correctly unlike your colleagues.  I do call into question the log checking since I was VERY clearly in Fury spec when I created the essence.  As I initially stated in the first ticket.  I was in tank spec.  Used the reliquaries and saw the dialog say ""current spec"".  Hit no and changed to fury (dps spec).  Then used them again.  It was my loot spec that did not change from tank to dps like I had expected it to.

&gt;And again the dialog read current specialization.  Not loot specialization.

&gt;I am finding it really hard to believe that this much effort is being expended to just flat out refuse to make a change to a simple mistake for a customer who has been subscribed and playing this game for as long as I have.

&gt;But that is okay.  I too am stubborn and will continue to strive for someone in the customer support team to eventually escalate this to someone who will have some small inkling of understanding and compassion for the customers that they support.  Especially the loyal ones.

&gt;Thanks for your time.

So now we come to the response that truly took the cake for me.  The issue finally reached a supervisor.  And his response was to threaten to perma-ban my account if I submitted anything further on this issue.

&gt;Hey there,  &lt;Melvalint&gt;, 

&gt;My name is &lt;SUPERVISOR NAME REDACTED&gt;, a supervisor here with Blizzard Entertainment. I understand you're not happy with our response to this issue. However, you have been provided with the correct information in the previous replies. 

&gt;Our logs indicate you were set to Prot for your loot preference, and the essence created matched up with this. The confirmation popup provides players with a warning to make sure they are not creating an item in error. Because of this safety measure, we do not reverse these when they are made in error. 

&gt;Due to this, we consider the matter closed. And any additional contacts about this matter will not receive a response and will result in disciplinary action against the battle.net account up to and including permanent account closure. 

&gt;I have sent an email to your gmail account with additional details about this warning. Please refer to that email if you have any questions about this. 

&gt;Thank you for your understanding on this matter. 

&gt;Regards, 

&gt;&lt;SUPERVISOR NAME REDACTED&gt;

So rather than submit another response there and have this supervisor and his holier-than-thou customer support staff perma-ban my account for asking why they think it is okay to treat their long standing, loyal customers this way, I decided to turn to Reddit.

This supervisor already went ahead and placed a warning on my account before another response was even sent.  It goes into great length about how because dialog boxes are in game, customer support will never fix items mistakes again.

I'm really just appalled at this experience with customer support since it is 150% the opposite of every other interaction I have ever had with a GM in the past 15 years.  Normally I get someone who spends 5 minutes role playing via emotes and such about how their character appears from the mists to aid me in my time of need.  It's silly and at times annoying, but they were ALWAYS super helpful and nice.  Not once did they try and tell me how a dialog box worked.  They never once tried to tell me that mistakes are part of life and I should just accept it ""like a Mythic raider would"".

I've been insanely loyal to Blizzard over all the years.  Whenever I left the game it wasn't because I felt it sucked, it was for real life stuff or just friends not being around anymore to play with.  I've stuck through this expansion despite all it's flaws.  I had just hoped that all that loyalty and time spent enjoying this game would warrant just a tiny amount of understanding and support from the customer support team.  Instead, I get met with what amounts to ""SHUT UP, NOOB!  GO AWAY OR I WILL SMITE YOU!""

EU - Zenedar

&amp;#x200B;

I started playing wow again a few weeks ago and this all went pretty fine, I was figuring out what to do and how to gear up since I stopped a few months after BFA release, so my gear was very outdated.

But today I hit 411 ILVL and I am looking for a challenge more or less and I want to progress more, but I am also well aware that this is not gonna happen.

Have 3x a week raid and do m+ on the other days. This leads to me having to swap traits almost every day (even multiple times if I have to switch rolls). This seems pretty stupid to me which is why I am having the same item multiple times, so I do not have to switch traits all the time. But this brings me to a decision, if I wanna have my highest azerite armor on either my dps or tank spec. But I want to generate the most value out of my gear, which seems to be impossible, because I have to swap to worse azerite armor for a different spec in this case.

I just wonder why Blizzard does not want us to choose azerite traits depending on our spec? Like let me pick my traits when I am playing ret and if I swap to pro, I can chose again and the traits picked will enable when I swap to the specific roll. This way I would not have to carry around dozens of different armor pieces and could always benefit from me actually having good gear on every spec. And if I want to swap traits within that spec, I am totally fine with going to Boralus/Dazar’alor to swap them.

Is this actually a thing or am I missing something? This could actually make it easier for people to try out other specs, because they are not afraid of having to farm new azerite gear or having to swap gear around multiple times just for trying purpose.

I wasn't necessarily excited or looking forward to the heroic warfront, nor am I a fan of warfronts in general, but I was interested to see what it would be like at a higher difficulty..

&amp;#x200B;

The first 4 minutes or so were the only part that even remotely resembled a warfront. We downed the initial boss, captured the base, then spread out and captured the mine and the woodworks. Less than 5 minutes into the warfront, Rokhan comes beating down our doors spamming chat like a lunatic, you knock him down to around 70% health, and then he bubble-hearths. We started to spread out again, and no more than a minute later Rokhan is spamming chat like an asshole and beating down our doors again. What then ensued was a 20 minute boss fight with Rokhan outside the front gates of our keep, waves of adds spawning in every 5 minutes or so, and at the end of the 20 minute slog-fest with Rokhan... The warfront ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Any resource gathering, or building, or capturing bases was all condensed into the first 5 minutes. After that point every single person in the group was just sitting on top of Rokhan trying to keep him from murdering our commander. How is this a ""Heroic Warfront""? Maybe other people had different experiences with it and it went differently for them, but from my perspective I just queued into a 25 minute boss fight, and not a particularly difficult one either. I'd love to know if others saw something different, maybe ours bugged out and we weren't actually supposed to kill Rokhan, but that definitely didn't feel like a warfront.

Hello fellow WoW players! My name is Noridra (my Toon name) and I am a postgraduate student at King’s College London. I am currently writing my dissertation on the reflections of culture that can be found throughout the game. The developers have created such a huge and vast world, but sometimes it seems as though we can see themes from cultures outside of the game. My aim is to explore those themes and reflections.

I have created a small survey that should take you about five minutes and it would help me tremendously if you’d provide your responses. 

Don’t worry, it is completely anonymous, and I won’t be collecting any personal data from you. I would just like to get a general overview of how players respond to what they see in game. Thank you so much and have a great day!

\*NB – I do ask for some demographic questions, but they are just to help correlate as to who feels the strongest about cultural themes in the game.

838,"I've noticed it far more this season because I'm pushing higher faster but you get some people who obviously play the game at a semi-pro level signing up just leaving at the first boss if the smallest thing goes wrong, even if the group is well ahead of the timer and set to do it in time.To be honest, for a lot of people just clearing the run for the weekly chest is enough so this is highly infuriating (especially when the key goes from +10 to +9 as the difference in loot is quite significant)

As it stands the leaver does not lose anything from leaving early if it is not their key and I just don't think that's fair. I suggest adding a deserter debuff that prevents them from starting another Mythic + for x amount of time, or at least just a debuff that marks them as a leaver so people might think twice about inviting them. It would be really nice if a note showed in the group finder like a compulsory note that says ""I recently left a group before the run was complete"".

EDIT: A lot of comments here have brought up issues that didn’t occur to me at the time and, to be honest, I completely agree with. Although I still think a way to tell who leaves for bad reasons is a good idea, I no longer think a debuff is the way to go about it. Instead I think some sort of karma or profile system would be a good idea like on steam profiles, where players can comment and give commends or reports. Also although I would love to see Blizzard implement this, it’s probably better left to Raider.io.

861,"So, there are quite a few problems with various classes in open world vs in raid content or even in pvp content. My favourite example is the combat rogue. In open world, the combat rogue continuously runs out of energy, compared to in raid the buffs from the raid give a continuous overflow of energy. The other problem is healers in general. In open world pve, their lackluster damage makes them poor choices for solo open world pve content. Unholy dk's also have issues with rune regeneration in open world, as compared to pvp or raid pve.   


So, what do you guys think of adding in passive abilities that are disabled in instanced pvp, and are also disabled in raid content? For example, I would love to see a passive that causes sinister strike to refund 50% of its energy cost if it is used after ANY other ability other than sinister strike. This is op as fuck in pvp and in raids, so thats why its disabled there. The other thing that would be cool is having many of the long cooldown abilities like Killing spree or the unholy move that rips the soul from the target to restore two runes reset on killing an opponent that yields experience or honor in open world.   


Again, this is for open world only, not raids. This means that these perks would not affect rated pvp, instanced pvp, or raid dps or healing. Thoughts?",Open world ONLY abilities,1
862,"Hello all! I recently bought the 25” Alienware 240hz monitor but am thinking I may have made a mistake by not going with the 34” 1440 monitor. I use my razer laptop currently. It’s specced at 2070mq 240hz 9th gen i7... on my laptop monitor I am getting 120-140fps besides in main cities or raids I drop to 60-70. All on ultra settings. I’m curious if anyone with a similar setup or in general can share their experience in FPS drops from changing monitors.

I plan on mainly playing WoW  classic on ultra, in the beta I was constantly around 300-350. In 40man areas I dipped to 200-240..

Both models have gsync... I’m picking the monitor up tomorrow and wondering if I should opt for the larger screen with higher resolution. I really only play WoW so I’m curious on FPS drops specifically with wow. Since I know it’s heavily cpu based, and the monitor is gpu based (if I’m thinking correctly).

I'm a tank and I like to use my own key so I have no problem getting a group. I did a +7 today to get my upgraded essence. I had a +8 but my group couldn't do it, so I got a new group for the +7 (waycrest) and it was fine. At this point, these 7+ keys with 3 affixes seem pretty tough. I'm watching dungeon guide videos, doing my best to interrupt and do the mechanics, using greater flasks (I'm an alchemist so it's not so bad), food, war-scrolls, and even tanked a heroic (which I probably could have done by myself, that's how nutty the power differential has gotten at this point) for the runes. I was trying my best at 100%. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see how people can have such high [raider.io](https://raider.io) scores for this season already (usually at least 500) unless they are just doing all the dungeons on like a +5 or whatever. I got some interesting luck and every key upgrade was the same dungeon (I legit thought they changed the rules for key upgrades or it was a bug), so other than a +4 I did with a group who invited me a long after we finished my key, I haven't had a chance to get scores from different dungeons.

908,"I used to run old raids routinely; every Tuesday hitting up the same raids, time and time again. I grew frustrated running them because I started to notice what appeared to be a growing trend; I would run Molten Core or other old raids with my hunter, only to get frustrated by all the drops being plate or cloth. Then when I would run Molten Core with my plate and cloth wearers, mail or leather would repeatedly drop. I felt this was blizzard giving us the proverbial carrot, to keep enticing us to play longer, by keeping the types of gear we wanted from dropping. True RNG, would mean a randomized amount of loot would drop every time, regardless of *which* class is doing the farming.

I wanted to test this theory, and compare and document these adventures. My World of Warcraft account had countless transmogs, pets, and mounts unlocked, thus making it difficult to ascertain real data. I knew I couldn't go back and retrace my steps. It was hard to assess what had dropped from each boss, with so much game time already amassed. I decided to create a brand new account, and test this theory. See how long it would take me to reach 100% of all the things collected in the game. That was the goal; collect 100% of all items in World of Warcraft, and share those findings with the community. I use a great add-on called All The Things, that helps track the exact percentage of items I have collected in particular zone, raid or dungeon.

I made a video about a first Molten Core run, and plan on running this every week with my Hunter, as an ongoing series to document what drops per run. Once I level more classes, I want to analyze how Blizzard truly doles out loot in old raids. I don't believe it's the RNG gods, acting benevolently on our be half (or cursing us in the process when we don't get something for months and months). 

I wanted to get some feedback on my first video, and hear from others if this is something they truly see. I get that mounts are a luck of the draw, but we can accurately glean some information by analyzing what types of items each boss drops each week. 

I will link my first video; it exceeded the 15 minute length time for posting videos here.

What would be cool is if depending on what equipment your class can use, you could transmog what you have equipped to anything within the boundaries of your class.
So if you would like to use a wand and an offhand, but your best equipment you have for your weapon slot is a staff, you could still use transmogrification to have your character use that wand and offhand.

Which would all be well and good, if Saurfang wasn't the one who planned the entire war, marched troops through Night Elf lands, killing everyone trying to defend themselves, with the explicit goal of 'inflicting a wound that would not heal' on the Kal'Dorei and the Alliance (so, even if he hadn't planned to burn nearly everyone alive, he certainly wouldn't have done a 'mere' war of conquest), and all that based on 'the Alliance *might* attack us in fifty years, or a hundred, so let's kill (almost) them all first'.    

Now, even if we forget it'sthe third genocide Saurfang is accidentaly a part of, even if he's truly sorry for what he did, the narrative is absolutely disgusting because it implies that you can commit horrible things, up to helping your leader commit litteral genocide, and you still get to say 'I was tricked, you should be angry at Sylvanas, not me!' and walk away a hero.

So, everyone and their mother assume that the two next AR are going to be vulperas and mechagnomes. And you can add me to the group as I do expect them to come in 8.2.5 or 8.3. However, I do have one SMALL issue with the mechagones, and that's, why would they agree to join the Alliance to figth the goblins?

&amp;#x200B;

Mechagnoes seen to have no story or rivalry with the goblins, they seen to get along quite well with them and are gratefull with both sides to help them in taking down their king. So far, it seen that there needs to be an event or reason for mechagnomes to stand against the horde, basicly, they only know two small groups of both sides and their aproach is what may decide the side they join. In fact, I have seen some people that claim that mechagnomes COULD side with the Horde because they think Overspark may fuck up the relationship and give the Alliance a bad look.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that may happen, but that does show how mechagnomes lack reasons to join a side cause they have to figth the other. In fact, this is the same reason why it bothered me when the Nigthbournes joined the Horde, yeah yeah, I know that Blizz said that the NE were mean to them and Alleria's void thing spook them, but I can think many ways they could had walk around that, and even with that, it felt really weird to dedicate almost a full patch to save their civilization and out of nowhere they say ""Hey, thanks for saving us and overthrow a tyrant that has been ruling over us for centurys, now we hate you and we will kill you, no hard feelings, bye"".

&amp;#x200B;

I do think mechagnomes do show SOME of the simptoms of the nigthbournes, and I would like to see how could they avoid that scenario. One idea that came, is that maybe Rustbolt could consider joining Gazlowe and the grease monkeys, but in the process, Gallywix could show up and screw up everything cause not even his mother can stand him. Maybe that could extend to an event where the goblins may had to side with Gazlowe or Gallywix but I'm being too hopefull.

Okay, onto the problem. DON’T LAUGH, but I’m playing on my 2015 MacBook Pro, so I don’t know if that’s an important.

On some fights the trait is close to useless because of large unavoidable damage, or requires some gimmick to keep it up ( like Cocooning/Nether Walking on Radiance, which is really not how Healer cds should be used ).

I would like the %hp treshold to be lowered, maybe make the trait like Treacherous Covenant was ( which, while risky, was far better for progression ).

1018,"Here is just a small update on where all of our heroes are currently, in Overwatch's current lore. The lore is... sparse, and pretty open-ended and vague for many heroes. We only know a few things for certain, and even then the plot hasn't changed. This includes the now 31 heroes + 3 confirmed future heroes (Echo, Mauga, and the Junkertown Queen).

# Hero Locations

**The New Overwatch (8)**:

* **Winston**, who initiated the recall and is waiting for past Overwatch members to return.
* **Tracer**, who responded to the recall. She is close friends with Winston as per the Christmas short.
* **Mei** answered the recall in *Rise and Shine* . She is currently exploring the various eco-Watchpoints that were shut down around the world.
* **Reinhardt** feels obligated to answer the recall in *Honor and Glory* as it is his duty.
* **Brigitte**, begrudingly, has joined Reinhardt to the new Overwatch. She's not a fan of how Overwatch treated Reinhardt (his treatment is hinted at in *Storm Rising*), and is only doing so for his sake.
* **Genji** is hinted at joining the new Overwatch, pleading with Hanzo in *Dragons* to join his cause as the world is changing once again.
   * **Zenyatta** is most likely going to join to assist his student, Genji. It is not clear though, but he's often attached to Genji in his lore. Jeff HAS confirmed that we will get Zenyatta lore soon... (Blizzard Soon^(TM))
* **Echo**, who we know nothing about, was reactivated and freed by McCree in *Reunion*. McCree told her that Overwatch was getting back together again, and she was needed. She is confirmed to be a future hero.

**Talon (7)**:

* **Doomfist**, one of the leaders of Talon's inner council. He is moving pieces around the world to bring another large conflict to take humanity to its next stage of evolution.
* **Reaper**, who used to be Gabriel Reyes, the leader of the Blackwatch (Overwatch's black ops department) has been disfigured since the incident in Switzerland. He is part of Talon but is also hunting down past Overwatch agents for unknown reasons.
* **Moira** is also part of Talon, with Talon funding all of her experiments without moral constraints - she is also the Minister of Genetics in Oasis.
* **Sombra** is Talon's hacker, although she seems to be using Talon for her own needs to uncover a massive conspiracy. Reaper and others are not fooled by Sombra though and know she has an ulterior motive - they don't seem to care as long as she gets the job done. The last known action of Sombra was doing Baptiste a favor in tracking Mercy down.
* **Widowmaker** is still the perfect and unfeeling assassin that Talon needs.
* **Sigma**, the latest hero, is being held by Talon. They only let him out when they need to take advantage of his powerful gravity manipulating powers.
* **Mauga**, a future Tank hero for Overwatch, is most likely alive. He had a giant confrontation with Baptiste, but after a giant explosion, his body was nowhere to be found. As a side note, because 1) his body is not found and 2) no one in this universe seems to stay dead, we can safely assume he's alive - however we do not know if he's sustained any scars or damage from the explosion.

**Other Organizations / Stationary (7)**:

* **Ashe** is the leader of the Deadlock Gang in the American southwest, who runs it with her Omnic servant, B.O.B.
* The **Junkertown Queen** is still the queen of Junkertown in the Australian wasteland. She's been confirmed as a future hero we know little about.
* **Zarya** was sent on a worldwide mission to track Sombra. While she found out some information, she also found out that Katya, her employer had some secrets. They decided for the good of Russia to keep their secret a secret, and she has gone back to the Russian's military front. She is unsure of what she'll do after that.
* **D.Va** is with the prestigious MEKA pilots in South Korea. She routinely defends South Korea from various Omnic attacks from the sea. She puts on a very glamorous persona for the South Korean public, but is shown to have a much more reserved personality in private with her friends as seen in *Shooting Stars*.
* **Orisa** is learning how to be a protector of Numbani with her creator, Efi.
* **Symmetra** is currently one of Vishkar's top agents. She is routinely sent to clandestine missions, with Vishkar telling her that what she is doing will bring order to the world - although she has her doubts.
* **Pharah** is currently working for Helix, a security firm - working on containing the Anubis A.I.. She wanted to join Overwatch and do good in the world before it disbanded. Her mother, Ana, sent her a note saying that she was alive - in *Bastet*, Ana says Pharah (Fareeha is her real name) had not responded to it but was hoping she'd come around in time.

**Exploring the World (12)**:

* **Torbjorn** is scouring the world for his past inventions, destroying many of his past machines and inventions which have fallen into the hands of terrible people. He is joined by **Bastion**, who is not functioning at all like a normal Bastion. It is likely Torbjorn has received the recall, but it is not clear what his reaction to it is.
* **Lucio** is currently doing concerts around the world (including Numbani), and knows he can make a difference around the world and change it for the better.
* **Hanzo** is unconfirmed to join the new Overwatch. As far as we know, he is still traveling the world in search of restoring his honor.
* **Junkrat** and **Roadhog** did a international crime spree in order to create a payload of treasure rigged with explosives to send to the Junkertown Queen. It's somewhat ambiguous if they succeed though.
* Hammond (or **Wrecking Ball** as he's known), is the Junkertown Scrapyard champion. He's currently out exploring the world for new adventures.
* **Soldier: 76** and **Ana** are on the trails of the Reaper, knowing that it's Gabriel Reyes. They've recently left their hide out in Necropolis, after taking care of some business nearby in the short story *Bastet*. It is unknown if they are aware of the new Overwatch recall (since they were marked as dead, it is unsure if they would receive the recall signall), or if they have, what their reaction to them would be.
* **McCree** awakened Echo after rescuing her from the Deadlock Gang in *Reunion*. He's taken Ashe's bike and is headed to take care of some business.
* **Baptiste** is currently on the run from Talon - and is running around the world to keep out of their sights. In *What You Left Behind*, He is currently headed to Mercy's last known location as they've previously worked together and he wants to keep her safe - with help tracking her down from Sombra.
* **Mercy** was last seen working on humanitarian efforts in the Middle East. It is likely she has received the recall, but it is unknown what her reaction to it is.

**Unknown (2)**:

* **Sojourn** is unknown. The last we know about her is that she led a small Overwatch Strike Team to capture Maximillian in *Storm Rising*. We know nothing about her current location, who she's affiliated, if she's with Overwatch/Talon, any of her combat abilities, if she's responded to the recall, etc.
* The **Ominous Purple Omnic** seen at the end of the *Storm Rising* event, who is speaking to Doomfist, is most likely going to be a hero or at the very least, a leader of an important Omnic faction in the Overwatch universe that will have a hero in it. All we know of him is that he's purple, and he was meeting with Doomfist.

# Lore in the Past Year

Lore has of course, become increasingly sparse. We are starting to see the rise of new short stories (which are tied into weekly challenges) but it remains to be seen if we will regularly get new short stories to move the story along.

**Animated Shorts**:

* Shooting Stars (starring D.Va)
* Reunion (starring McCree, with supporting cast of Ashe, B.O.B. and Echo)

Short Stories:

* Bastet (starring Soldier: 76 and Ana)
* What You Left Behind (starring Baptiste, with Mauga and Agent Nguyen being supporting roles)

Origin Stories:

* Ashe's Origin Story
* Baptiste's Origin Story
* Sigma's Origin Story

We have not received a comic in a while, with the last comic being Retribution on April 4, 2018.

1056,"So me and my friend [/u/CloudZani](https://www.reddit.com/u/CloudZani/) were messing around as Sigma on the PTR and we happened to stumble upon a bug!

By clicking M1 and M2 immediatly afterwards the amount of orbs fired is doubled, and therefor the damage is too.

So  instead of shooting a volley of 2 orbs doing a total of 120 damage,  Sigma shoots 4 orbs doing a total of 240 damage! So Sigma is effectively  able to oneshot all 200HP heroes! even 250HP heroes with a melee at the  end of each volley.

\[EDIT\]: After messing around with some macro timings I managed to get 5 orbs pretty consistently! even 6 orbs at times :) That's 360 damage!

&amp;#x200B;

When trying figuring out how the bug works I found out that it's quite hard to do consistently. **(Using a macro spamming M1 and M2 works really well though),** It also prevents you from using your barries. Which is really unfortunate. But HEY! EXTRA DAMAGE!! ONESHOTTING!! Right?

Feel free to ask questions about the bug! Ill try to answer as good as i can.

Brigitte on PTR took huge hit to her survivability with this and self-healing nerf. I am not sure what exactly they want from this character.

It looks like they want her to stay in the back and support her teammates that way, but her healing like that is just not enough. Changes to her Repair Pack are not good enough for Brigitte to be viable and played this way. She is designed to dive with her team to be able to heal them and herself, because she is one of the shortest ranged heroes in the game, changes to her don't make any sense to me.

1080,,PTR Zen glitch? Quickly charged and released 3 orbs without using ammo.,0
1081,"I have played around 150-200 hours of Overwatch, and throughout this period I have reached level 195. Since around level 150 or so the players I have been matching against have been rising in average level, and now my average game, (60-80% of the time now), I am the lowest leveled player with most other people in the lobby being at LEAST two hundred levels higher than me. After being matched in an 8 player FFA with every other player other than myself being well over level 500, I decided I wanted to discuss this problem with other players that might have experienced this same situation or know what causes it. This problem persists even when playing quick play, arcade, and competitive. There may be occasions where I feel up to the challenge of playing against players with anywhere between two to ten times my experience, but being matched against high level players has caused a number of problems for me.

My friends range from level 10-60, and when I queue up with them, even in quick play, we still are often matched up against high level teams, though maybe not to the degree when I solo queue. As multiple of my friends are new to the game, most of our games can be dissatisfying and hard for my friends to learn from, as any mistake they make is punished so hard that they are not able to play freely enough to have fun while learning what does and doesn't work. It sucks a lot of the enjoyment out of playing with my friends, and as a result a lot more of our time playing Overwatch has been spent playing in private matches, which only have so much mileage, and have cut our game sessions short out of boredom.

My second and more personal problem I have with being matched with players at a higher level than myself is that although there are pros to this situation, such as being able to improve faster and occasionally get carried while I am experimenting with a new character, playing late at night after work or while I am tired and just want something to do is not nearly as much fun. I used to be able to play this game after building up stress or anxiety, but now it is not as satisfying as my overall success in the game has gone down because I am playing with other players who are so much more experienced.

I am only matched in a game with the majority of the players being +-100 levels of myself, around a quarter of the time, and I am usually able to play very well and often win in that scenario, especially if I am playing with my lower level friends, could this be why I am usually matched against higher levels? I am waiting for my friends to improve a little before I start playing more ranked, so far I have usually only done my placement matches for a few seasons or so, but while player levels there seemed all over the place, the majority have still been at least a hundred to two hundred levels higher than me.

Why could this be? Does Overwatch have a hidden skill point system for casual that matches me with higher players based off of some inner variable? Or am I just over analyzing the randomness of the matchmaking system? Is the player population around my level just small right now, and that's why I usually don't see the majority of players in my game closer to my level? I know that it's not something that can be fixed/changed, but I am curious as to the why&amp;how for me being matched with players of such a high level.  


tl;dr:  
Most of my Overwatch matches are with players several hundred levels higher than me, and I am wondering why this is and if anyone else has experienced the same thing.",Matchmaking against high level players,0

Aside from the explanation being because of his mental illness and he wasn't allowed to wear shoes when he was locked up is an ok response but then people were also questioning the floating thing seems too fake.

Well for one it's a video game yes but hear me out this was a really big shower thought in my mind.

Wouldn't it make sense that with his feet exposed his abilities from the accident have a more direct connection to the ground and he can use this gravity to repel himself at will? Cause even though a black hole pulls and consumes so much energy and mass, if it is eating at a fast enough rate it has the power to push large objects out with such force that they are sent out of the black holes system. Compare it to a messy eater if you would, the eater will consume 80% of something but the rest is everywhere but they're stomach. Stellar Mass Black Holes from what I learned in high school have some of the most ""aggressive eating"" tendencies and consume mass incredibly fast.

Now take Sigma, if Sigma was experimenting with stellar bodies and the ability to harness gravity, as he briefly created the Black Hole for that single brief moment he was exposed to whatever energies he was hit with including X-Ray energy (the energy that is most commonly found from Black Holes) we dont know what that would do to a human body in real life. But in this case we will say that Sigma in the sense of gravity with similar abilities to what Black Holes do, needs to have his feet exposed so he can more efficiently repel from the earth's gravity and control his Hypersphere's in the same way, the repel and attraction a Black Hole is capable of.

1134,"Is everyone on board with the 2-2-2 system? I can see some glaring issues with the system and I ultimately think it will actually end up hurting the game in the long run. Every player is not going to be good at every hero in every role. So imo I think it's actually going to promote one tricks and create more toxicity in the community about switching heroes and flexing. 
     e.g. I can play Rein but I can't play Zarya, but the team needs her. Either I switch to her and basically do nothing for the or I keep playing Reinhardt because I know how to play him. However, our current healer mains Zarya. I now cannot switch to play a healer and neither can the healer switch with me. I'd be totally useless playing Zarya and somewhat useless playing Reinhardt, so I'm gonna stick with him and not switch. Now it's my fault we lost because I didn't switch even when we had someone on the team willing to fill the tank role but couldn't because they were stuck in a different role.

I'm not gonna just complain about something and not try to come up with a solution to this problem. And I have 3 ideas off the top of my head:
1. Don't lock the player to the role but instead have that the other characters in that role lock when 2 are selected. I know this in itself has its own issues, say of a person selecting any hero in a role to lock that role for themselves and then switching to a different hero once the match started. I think however that is far superior to the current version.
2. Let me unselect my current hero so I can switch with someone else. Has anyone else tried to switch with a hero somebody else is playing because you're better with that hero but you have to select a different hero to open up that hero for the other person to select? Well having a system where you could unselect a hero would allow for someone in a different role to pick a hero in the role you were just by effectively Making your slot in that role open for grabs.
3. Instead of two two two have a system where you need a minimum of 1 hero per roll. This would allow for much more team composition flex and the same time pretty much kill goats because you can't have 3-0-3. The most you could have is 4 of one role. You could even make the role locked at a maximum of three heroes.

Personally the system I would choose is number 3 because you still have the ability to switch heroes and flex without being locked to one role/hero for an entire match. It's important to be able to switch your current composition to counter the enemy's comp or better suit what the team needs. 

Thanks for reading this and I would like to know what Reddit thinks of the 2-2-2 system or my proposed changes. Again, thanks.

tl;dr: the 2-2-2 system is too strict with locking players to a hero/role for an entire match and is going to make players more toxic.

1140,"Foreword: Apologies in advance for explaining (or at least trying to) a bunch of different stuff, but I felt it was necessary in case someone didn't know how black holes work. Without further ado:

___

As shown in his origin story, and the story description for his Hero Page, one of Sigma's experiments on an International Space Station went wrong, and somehow managed to briefly create a black hole.

&gt; ""But something went wrong, triggering the brief formation of a black hole. De Kuiper was only exposed to its power for a moment, but he suffered serious psychological damage.""

But why would being exposed to a black hole cause psychological damage? Aside from the whole concept of gazing into the abyss, there's something black holes affect aside from gravity. 

**Time.**

___

The closer you get to a black hole, the slower time progresses. And this isn't a linear increase, it's exponential. 

The closer you get, the greater the rate at which time slows down. Two objects: X distance and 2X distance away from the black hole respectively, could be perceiving time at inconceivably different rates, even though the measurable distance from the black hole is only double.

Since a black hole is a point in space that is infinitely dense, the event horizon is where time moves infinitely slow. This applies to even the smallest of black holes, made of small amounts of infinitely dense matter. The difference is that the extremes of its effects on gravity / time are limited to a relatively small area.

&gt; ""The field is failing!""

As we can see in his origin story, Sigma was exposed to a such a black hole. Since he didn't do it on purpose, this exposure may have been due to the failure of sort of 'field' used to confine the black hole's effects. We can see him being distorted and 'torn apart' by the gravitational field, but with the the space station being left in tact. This means that the distance required for two objects near the black hole to be moving at markedly different speeds is minuscule. Instead of being protected from the black hole, he was exposed its entirety.

**The result?**

___

Different parts of Sigma's brain would have been affected to different extents. Regions further away from the black hole could have been functioning several times faster, if not countless orders of magnitude faster than areas closer to the black hole. Even if it was for only a brief instant, who knows what that does to the human consciousness?

In what we would perceive to be a fraction of a second, part of Sigma's mind could have been aware for near infinitely more time than the other. Did it simply cause a physical disconnect, or was his consciousness ripped in two? Perhaps he has a single consciousness, perceiving regular time, while having the understanding that comes from witnessing eternity.

Regardless, as we can see with Tracer's abilities, Overwatch's universe operates using 'don't think about it' science. We don't know how Sigma's mind works, and I don't really think we need to. I just thought it was pretty interesting that there's an actual explanation behind 'black hole exposure' causing mental trauma.

___

**TL;DR:** Black holes warp time. The entirety of a small black hole's time warping effect would be limited to a small area. Different parts of Sigma's mind would have experienced time differently, distorting his consciousness.

**Primary fire-** Roadhog RMB range bouncy explosives. After playing it's visible that there is very minor CC with primary fire, moving enemies toward the detonation very very slightly.Also important, you will damage yourself if these detonate too close to you.

**Secondary-** 1500 HP barrier similar to old symettra. Moves in aimed direction while holding RMB, stops on release. Pressing RMB again recalls it. Shield HP recharges while shield is stored. Unaffected by gravity.

**Shift-** Absorbs incoming hitscan/projectiles and converts damage into up to 400HP of shields. (~~For example, Zarya grav will still go off, but the damage from it will be absorbed by the shift ability~~)

**E-** Gathers rocks and throws them. Hitting close range will do damage only, hitting longer range will provide knockback CC

**Ultimate-** Rises into the air to cast a black hole. Enemies in range will be lifted into the air for a short duration and then slammed into the ground for 50% of maximum HP. Ultimate can also be used to reposition to high ground, as you can float seemingly to skybox during casting.

**Technically not a passive-** He does float and has no footsteps as a result.

Every time the match sends you back to the main menu it counts as a leaving, so my endorsement rating is plummeting and have gotten a massive leaver penalty for 12 games. Then it just sends me right back into the match where the lobby crashes yet again

Am I the only one who think that Zarya becomes less and less effective with all these new shield heroes? Orisa, Brigitte, now Sigma... As someone who loves Zarya playstyle most of all - it's disappointing to realize that it is harder and harder to utilize her beam to melt enemies, also considering that her ult can stuck anytime in midair because of stupid timing of enemy shield. I mean, it was enough for me to switch from Zarya if enemy team have Rein or Winston. It's really annoying to fight against shields with Zarya gun. And now we have + Orisa and Sigma.... Looks like Roadhog is way better choice in 85% of matches?

I was watching Seagull play Sigma just now and told him about the hero's cool new abilities, since his doctor told him he can't really watch anything yet. I said he would really enjoy playing Sigma once he's all patched up. He then asked me to name all the tanks so he could remember.

1389,"EDIT || I'm talking about specifically noticing this after this PTR patch with the 2-2-2 introduction, I know PTR MMR is probably skewed because of the lower amount of players but I still wanted to discuss it since this is the first time I've noticed this on PTR and the difference is significat enough to be strange imo

So my Live MMR is Diamond and up, I don't play Comp actively, I have done 4-5 season placements and am Diamond as a support main. On Live I actually have a problem where I feel like my QP MMR is higher than it should be, often being placed in matches with Masters and up. I play 90% of the time supports, 8% tanks and 2% DPS.

On PTR my QP MMR is silver/gold for some reason. I noticed this after, frankly, noticing a big difference in the skill level of my teammates compared to my Live QP games (not to be mean, I was surprised how noticable it was myself). On PTR I have queued for healer/DPS and today added tanks in case i get a chance to try Sigma, out of multiple games I once got DPS role and all the rest I got healing. They apparently have been tracking your role specific MMR for months on Live so I'm just thinking if what we experience on the PTR could be that already or if they are still calibrating or if the player count on the PTR is simply too low to accurately portray your MMR? This is not a post to complain that I deserve higher MMR or anything like that, I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed the same issue and want to discuss it

1396,"Hello everyone, I was previously a Grandmaster player and was on two semi-pro teams. I had to quit Overwatch a 2-3 years ago due to a strange issue that never went away, but blizzard is obviously not taking responsibility for the issue so I'm here wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I had assumed that they would fix the problem over some time so I've tried waiting it out but no luck.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is by far the most common when playing Genji specifically but affects all heroes I've tried. So what happens is shooting animations play twice and mimic rubber banding. To be clear there's no actual rubber banding in-game for me other than on the shooting animations. I have two clips on twitch of this issue here:

**0:42- Most obvious example of it happening**

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368002566](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368002566)

&amp;#x200B;

**0:58 - Another Example**

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/371643201](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/371643201)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind when watching the videos even if you don't see double animations at any given point in time there's still a very significant delay in the shot going off that resembles input lag. Or almost like the shot is queuing and shooting late. This lag happens quite often but seems sporadic; there's never a game where it doesn't happen but it doesn't coincide with the in-game icons or even the net graph. The strange part is my ping is quite stable as well.

I had blizzard even call me of their own accord (I didn't request a call) to look into the issue and escalate it because they had never been aware of the issue. They looked into it and told me there was definitely an issue and after running tests they inferred there was nothing wrong with my tests. After were able to reproduce the issue (their QA team found it) they refused to disclose how they did so. I tried asking them at least 3-4 times how they reproduced it but they refused to tell me. They told me I needed to find more people that had the issue before they would do anything about it or even tell me what it was. But they also implied its an issue that could be patched/fixed. The only suggestion they gave me was to use a VPN, even though I told them it didn't help at all.

So they more or less left me in limbo, which is frustrating because I wanted to pursue becoming a pro/streamer for the game. So the curious thing that I'm trying to figure out is whether this problem is specific to my province or Canada. The thing that baffles me is I never see any streamers with similar symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Link to the thread I posted on Blizzard forums:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So the TLDR:**

Shooting Animations play twice as well as significant shot delay/input lag. Sometimes even ability animations will play twice. No other symptoms of lag are present other than that.

* Tested on two ISPs: Telus (DSL and Fibre) &amp; Shaw.
* Tested at a gaming Cafe in downtown Edmonton with Telus Fibre; same issue.

1397,"Siebren de Kuiper, Age: 62

Occupation: Astrophysicist

Base of Operations: The Hague, Netherlands (formerly)

Affiliation: Talon

#""THERE IS NO OBLIGATION FOR THE UNIVERSE TO MAKE SENSE TO YOU.""


&gt;Brilliant astrophysicist Dr. Siebren de Kuiper's life changed forever when an experiment gone wrong gave him the ability to control gravity; now, Talon manipulates him to their own ends.

&gt;De Kuiper was considered a pioneer in his field. His life's work involved devising a way to harness the power of gravity. Equally known for his groundbreaking research and eccentric personality, he conducted most of his studies from his lab in The Hague. Believing that he was close to achieving his goal, he performed his most important experiment on an international space station.

&gt;But something went wrong, triggering the brief formation of a black hole. De Kuiper was only exposed to its power for a moment, but he suffered serious psychological damage. The area around him began to experience strange fluctuations in gravity, peaking and dropping in time with his reactions. He had to be evacuated immediately.

&gt;Upon returning to Earth, De Kuiper was quarantined in a secret government facility. Between his ravings about the patterns of the universe, the psychic damage he sustained, and the gravitic anomalies happening around him, he was deemed unsafe and detained for years under the name ""Subject Sigma."" Isolated and unable to control his powers, De Kuiper retreated into his own mind. He thought he would never see the outside world again.

&gt;When Talon discovered De Kuiper's existence, they infiltrated the facility and broke him out, planning to use his brilliance and research to further their plans. In their custody, De Kuiper slowly gained control of his powers. Now, gravity moved according to his will, and he was closer than ever to achieving his life's goal. But the same experiment that had opened his mind had also fractured it, and he struggled to keep the pieces together.

&amp;#x200B;

Saw this article had some news not yet known, decided to translate it (roughly.)

&amp;#x200B;

Please correct any mistakes you might see.

&amp;#x200B;

Hero 31 goes through life as Sigma, but he isn't born under that name. Sigma once was born as Siebren de Kuiper in Den Haag. Overwatch will soon get a Dutch Hero. We wanted to know more about that, and luckily we got the chance to talk to some members of the Overwatch team. And we didn't just pick some random ones. We talked to Geoff Goodman, Lead Hero Designer and Michael Chu, Lead Writer. We also spoke to Chu more than a year ago about the introduction of Moira. Also available was Joshua Noh, Associate Game Designer and Alyssa Wong, Associate Writer. In short, the quartet that is responsible for both the story of Sigma as well as his abilities in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

To start with the story, it is apparent early on that De Kuiper is an outstanding figure. He is very intelligent and develops himself as prominent astrophysicist, specialized in researching black holes, dark matter and manipulating gravity. Through his expertise he gets the chance to research on an international space station. Something of course goes wrong there. It exists for yet a fraction of a second, but despite that has a big influence, especially on de Kuiper. He takes heavy psychological damage. And not just that, he gains the possibility to manipulate gravity. That makes him a danger for his surroundings, and he gets captured and locked up. He spends years in solitary confinement, until Talon frees him, one of the two fighting factions in Overwatch. Talon also locks up de Kuiper, but they sometimes set him free to fight at the front, where his newly gained powers are of big value.

&amp;#x200B;

Sigma, as de Kuiper is known on the battlefield, is still a genius, but also a little eccentric. Sometimes he seems a little confused, like a professor can be. That doesn't mean he's not a feared warrior. Not crazy, if you know what kind of options Sigma has on the battlefield. His primary directly shows his background. Hyper Spheres are two small gravity gerenades who need a little time to explode, but then do a lot of damage in a small radius. His secondary is the Experimental Barrier, a shield that Sigma can place where he wants to, also quite far from him. His first ability is called Kinetic Grasp, and with that Sigma can catch incoming projectiles and convert into a small personal shield. His second ability is Accretion, with which he manipulates gravity to gather grit and bundle it into a big block of rubble that he can throw a fair distance. His last ability is Gravity Flux, with which he can lift enemies off the ground and powerfully smite them back into the ground. That sounds good, but also calls up the necessary questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: We like Sigma being Dutch a lot, but can we see it in the game as well?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Chu: You can primarily hear it. He has some Dutch texts, so he doesn't only speak English but also his mother tongue. His voice is done by Boris Hiestand, a Dutch actor. Besides that, we also have a few Dutch employees in Blizzard who we consulted with the design of Sigma. They helped making up his actual name and with sharing the storyline we will reveal soon. If I have to believe them, Sigma has a lot of characteristics that make him look Dutch. He is for example tall and slim, like a lot of Dutch men. We involved the Dutch early  in the process. Our first question: what do you think about a Dutch astrophysicist, is that possible? They pointed to the long history of the Netherlands on that field, which would make that background very fitting. They also helped with deciding on his birth city. The choice of Den Haag (The Hague) is mostly because Blizzard has an office there nowadays. It's therefore mostly fun for us.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why did you pick the Netherlands? We're a small country that wasn't on top of the list.

&amp;#x200B;

A: Chu: We don't have a list with countries that we sort by area and population, we aren't that scientific. We mostly have a raw sketch of the design and personality, and then we brainstorm. On the basis of popculture and some historical knowledge from the team, a Dutch scientist seemed like a fitting candidate. Basically every country is interesting, so the Netherlands is too. The background for Sigma seemed very fitting and we worked starting from that idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Sigma's real name is Siebren de Kuiper. Did Gerard Kuiper, the namesake of the Kuiperbelt in the solar system form the inspiration for that?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Chu: Siebren's last name is absolutely a homage to Gerard Kuiper, but it doesn't go furtherthan name. This astronomer isn't really an example for Sigma's personality. We used an idea that already was circulating within the team. It was actually an ide afrom Jeff Kaplan, Project Leader. He had the idea for quite a time to add an eccentric genius into the game. That was an interesting idea. We already had some scientists, but this one definitely felt quite different to the ones we have.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What was the starting point, the crazy professor or his nationality?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Noh: Neither. We didn't add a Tank to the game for a while so that was the starting point. This also was what the community was saying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Geoff: Every hero starts in a different way. In this case we had a prototype of the gameplay. That prototype was there a while before the visible design of the Hero. Actually, in first case we had a completely different design for Sigma, but that didn't feel quite right. His design went through a lot of changes

&amp;#x200B;

Chu: The characters we had for our eyes, didn't work because it was too aggressive. The character that we had was someone who would directly dive in everywhere, and that didn't work with the gameplay. And we were more enthusiastic about the gameplay. Therefore Sigma is one of the exceptions where we started the design from scratch.

&amp;#x200B;

Geoff: Yeah, when we started with designing hero 31 the first comment during the meeting was ""we need a new tank."" Not just that, we needed a specific tank. (he goes into explaining the difference between anchor tanks and other tanks). We were looking for a new anchor tank, so we started with collecting ideas for one.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: So the shield was the starting point?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Noh: Yes, we gave Sigma a shield first and then we looked for options that would fit with that. We experimented quite a bit with that. At first sigma was a lot more mobile and he was able to keep himself standing. But because of that players had a tendency to walk away from the team, and that wasn't what we wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: It probably also was a goal to make more players pick a Tank

&amp;#x200B;

A: Geoff: Of course we want players to have more choices. If you look at the current composition, damage heroes are very represented. So we are primarily looking for good ideas for Tanks and healers.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: The Dutch colleagues helped with designing Sigma. Did you also listen to feedback from the community with designing Sigma?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Noh: Not really. We already get a lot of feedback from people within the company. That's so useful, that we don't need anymore feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: How many people work on a character like Sigma?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Geoff: Quite a lot. There are a lot of people where a new character passes by. Maybe like 80.

&amp;#x200B;

Chu: The design gets a lot of stadia. The original gameplay-design mostly comes from a single dev. In this case it was Joshua Noh who had an early working prototype. Then it's still not a hero. We have a tool and a scripting language where we can edit the properties of a Hero. Then we connect that to the appearance of a random other hero. There we try to figure out if it's fun to play the new hero. That mostly forms the base. But after that there is a whole list of colleagues who work with the Hero. From artists to programmers to sound people and effects people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Noh: It's also the colleagues you don't expect, like the people who build the levels. We place a new Hero in the biggest part of the levels, to see if they come into their own. Finally basically the entire team is involved in the design.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: In Sigma's biography there's a few outstanding properties, like his childish imagination and the difficulty he has on concentrating. What do I notice in game? Hopefully not too much of the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

A: Wong: You mostly notice it because of what he says. You hear him make observations from the distance. In contrast to most of the other heroes Sigma is less interested in the development of the battle. You can hear him make a comment about the interesting trajectory a projectile has. Then there's his curiosity towards the world around him, everything in a different way to his colleagues. But it isn't that he becomes unplayable because of a lack of concentration. You only notice his comments. With that he is really the confused professor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q: How do the properties of Sigma stand next to Reinhardt and Orisa?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Chu: Sigma floats over the battle, not hindered by gravity. Because of that he has bare feet (oh god why). He travels at the same pace as the other heroes. His primary causes about as much damage as Reinhardt, but they have a small area of effect and you can throw them quite far so you can stay a safe distance away. They have a long reload time so you have to be careful in the use, and also in aiming. It's not like Junkrat who can carpet bomb an entire hallway full of projectiles.

&amp;#x200B;

Noh: His secondary is the floating shield. If you hold the button the shield floats away in the direction you look at. The shield floats, so it can also be placed quite high. You can recall the shield whenever you want to. Sigma is very useful if a team gets attacked from the high ground. There is also a downside. The shield takes damage that slowly regenerates if it isn't used. That accelerates when the shield is recalled. If you recall and then place it the shield is still damaged. The shield doesn't block everything, just projectiles so no Symmetra, Zarya or Winston.

&amp;#x200B;

Geoff: Kinetic Grasp looks like [D.Va](https://D.Va) defense Matrix. It catches all incoming projectiles that turn into a personal shield. You can use that with the floating shield, and also in two different directions. It is mostly useful for when your shield is recharging, although it has a 15 second cooldown. It's mostly small tactical choices when playing Sigma.

&amp;#x200B;

Noh: it gets interesting with Accretion. You can throw the rubble quite far, but there's some weight so you need to aim up and that makes it fun. The damage doesn't really matter, you can damage enemies, but it's mostly the knockdown, so the delay you cause with it. And the best part is that the knockdown increases the farther you throw the rubble.

&amp;#x200B;

Chu: Gravity Flux, the ultimate connects seamless to that. We put a lot of work in it. With that you can also hinder the enemies. With both you can delay enemy teams quite a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: If you pick Sigma in a match, for what property do you pick him?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Geoff: His shield, it's very handy. The option to place it where you want is nice. Say Soldier is in high ground behind a window. Then you can send the shield up and block the entire window. And if a Pharah floats through the air and fires rockets, you can move the shield with the enemy and then block all projectiles. No other tank can do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Noh: I have a lot of fun with accretion. We've been planning for quite some time to add an ability like that in the game, so I am happy that it's finally time. A similar idea was originally in Doomfist's design, but it didn't fit with him. The idea kept floating around. In the meantime we tried it with a bunch of different heroes. With Sigma we finally have a hero where it fits.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Finally, when can we try Sigma and when does he get an Orange skin (orange is the Dutch national colour)

&amp;#x200B;

A: Noh: Sigma can come out at any time in the PTR. The video where we give his background comes out next week. We hope Sigma gets in the game for real in a few weeks. You also don't have to wait long for the skin.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: More speculation, is the next hero a support from Belgium? It's probably a coincidence, but 31 is the Dutch country code for phones, and Belgium's is 32. There will be 7 tanks soon but 6 supports.

&amp;#x200B;

A: Geoff: It would make it quite easy if we can get new heroes that way. We know that we have a lot of damage heroes, and we want to fill the holes. At the same time, we don't want to lose our damage players so we need to keep them happy.",Dutch Interview about Sigma translated to English,0

1416,"So this was a discussion between friends that ended up being a good amount of fun.  

What if Blizzard released a line of skins from an ""alternate universe"" that introduced 26 new characters that were just gender swaps for the existing heroes.  No changing abilities, just artwork.  This would potentially double the roster of characters and interactions without requiring an ounce of balancing.  

In that spirit: the rules: 

*Model has to use the same hitbox.  So LadyHog has gotta be big.  

*Character has to fulfill the same role, but any amount of lore can change what it literally is.  EG: Brigette can become a Zulu Warrior with shield and spear.  

*Minimal love interests, because that's lame and cliche.  

*Robots are already gender neutral.  

So my thoughts: 

1. **Tracer** - Parkour style freerunner.  Instead of time travel he does super cool backflips and acrobatic stunts to bounce all over the place.  
2. **Ana** - The Commissar.  Cartoon version of a WWII Russian officer that shot his own men to 'motivate' them.  
3. **Widowmaker** - Literally Sniper from TF2
4. **Pharah** - [The Rocketeer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cc/Rocketeermovieposter.jpg/220px-Rocketeermovieposter.jpg), 1940's era Art Deco hero.
5. **Winston** - 12 year old girl riding her [Bulldog](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/9deca191-b8f3-4c12-accc-da2ce647d5c8/scale-to-width-down/800). 
6. **McCree** - Annie Oakley.  A riff on [Jessie](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0013/5649/7014/products/Toy_Story_Jessie_UDF_1024x1024.jpg?v=1546541208) from Toy Story.
7. **Roadhog** - Literally the current Road Hog model in a 2-piece swimsuit.  Call it RoadHog's Mom. 
8. **Junkrat** - Smaller girl with all her limbs, a character riff on [Tiny Tina](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/borderlands/images/a/ab/Tiny_Tina-transparent-sm.png/revision/latest?cb=20180419192706) from Borderlands 2. 
9. **Mei** - Poison not fire.  Dress him like the [Engineer](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Engineer.png/250px-Engineer.png) from TF2, but make the character famously bad at building, which is why his ~~ice~~ wall keeps breaking so quickly. 
10. **Moira** - Pedo-looking guy that really is just throwing cat piss and purple drank everywhere. 
11. **Wrecking Ball** - Wal-Mart Woman that is as wide as she is round.  Wobbles while walking, rolls by tucking arms in.  Holstered SMG's, and Mines that deploy from a fanny pack.  
12. **Brigitte** - Zulu Warrior carrying Shield &amp; Spear.  Spear has range to cover the spread, and can have a lunge animation instead of whip-shot for the ability. 
13. **Baptiste** - [Voodoo healer](https://live.staticflickr.com/3908/15150108177_a07b3b2bfa_b.jpg) that tosses potions and throws Genji-Darts.  
14. **Mercy** - A riff on the TF2 Medic.  Psychopath doctor that encourages his patients to seek injury to test his ""experiments"".  Flies to ""observe"".  
15. **Hanzo** - [Night Watchman](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/e5/8c/e7e58cdc0eff21fc10c8b1bf3a00517e.jpg) or [Waywatcher](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XtNCM9ymHoA/maxresdefault.jpg).  Complains about everything all the time. 
16. **D.Va** - A Mutant Turtle with dual shotguns.  Drops out of his shell in lieu of a mech suit.  
17. **Lúcio** - Cali-Style skater girl that uses a Skateboard over Rollerblades. 
19. **Genji** - Jessica Rabbit/Spy Lady that throws hairpins and hidden blades. Outside of combat, we never see a weapon.  
20. **Symmetra** - English Spy/James Bond type that places ""cameras"" everywhere.  Ultimate: Drawing indiscriminate borders in the middle of conflict zones.  
21. **Sombra** - [Boris from Goldeneye](https://hxkyx44ph6g3vhzqosgkpy30-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG0013_140851618_140851619_252089452_Carousel.jpg).  Definitely has a ""Girlfriend in Canada"".  
23. **Ashe** - John-Wayne style cowboy.  
21. **Soldier 76** - Laura Croft analog.  Keeps talking about ""Checkpoints"" when dropping the healing aura.  Rocket could be bow attack with clever animation work. 
22. **Zarya** - A priest protecting his flock.  Casts ""Blessings"" to protect himself and allies.  
23. **Doomfist** - UFC Wrestler that uses scissor leg-locks to carry opponents into the air.  
24. **Reinhardt** - Sorceress with magical shield, fireballs, and large wizard's staff. Small character with an outfit so blinged out it makes up for the rest of Rein's armor.
26. **Torb** - Mona from IT.  Give her turrets more of a Symmetra art style.  Short and fat like a sterotypical Indian grandma. Beard optional.  
27. **Reaper** - Ballerina with two larger shotguns that pirouettes in lieu of teleportation and ghosting.  

So there's my list. Some are definitely better than others, but I'm curious to see what everyone thinks!",ITT: We gender swap all the characters.,0

The toxicity in quick play is really, really demoralising. I know competitive is a little more 'grown-up' and people are less likely to be cruel, but it's really upsetting when people are screaming and swearing at you when you're trying to learn new characters in quick play, or have a good time.

1461,"So I know not everyone has the ability to watch a video or play the PTR to see what Sigma is like, so I figured I'd create a quick post to let everyone know what he's like.

Primary Fire - Hyperspheres: Two round burst, fires one burst about every second.  Projectiles travel \~22-23 meters or until they hit a target and explode. Projectiles can and will ricochet off of walls before exploding, and appears to affect range if you do, I'd wager by half of range left.  Direct impact does 60 damage, and minimum appears to be about 12-15 per orb.  The projectile speed feels comparable to Zenyatta's primary fire, possibly a bit slower. Has a minor arc, but nothing remarkable.  Cannot headshot, so aim for the body.

Secondary Fire - Experimental Shield:  You remember Symmetra 2.0's projected barrier?  It's that.  Fire by holding secondary fire, shield stops when you release secondary fire.  Pressing Secondary fire again recalls the shield.  The shield has 1500 Health, and is about a foot taller than Reinhardt's shield, but about 2 feet less wide, give or take.  The shield stays out until it is either destroyed or recalled, and will only regenerate when it is recalled for about 2.5 seconds, and regenerates at about 150 HPS.  If the shield completely breaks, you have to wait 5 seconds before using it again.  There is no cooldown on the shield if it does not break

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimate - Gravitic Flux:  AOE attack with about a 7.5 m radius.  Damage is not affected by distance from center, but rather by health.  This ultimate appears to do 50 damage when launching up, then slams you down for exactly 50% of your MAX health as damage (Ie, roadhog would normally take 300, but Soldier 76 takes only 100).  After the ultimate starts, for 5.5-6 seconds, you fly into the air similar to Mercy's ultimate, able to move vertically and horizontally freely.  While flying, your cursor becomes a targeting circle for the ultimate, and the attack begins with primary fire.  Once the attack starts, you will float during the casting and will be able to use primary fire and secondary fire.  You CAN be stunned out of the ultimate, however the attack appears to go through if the attack is started before the stun.

&amp;#x200B;

First/shift ability - Kinetic Grasp:  A whopping 15 Second cooldown, and for good reason.  This ability is practically a smaller version of [D.va](https://D.va)'s Defense Matrix.  The Grasp is a small field about as wide as Matrix and reaches about 2 meters in front, and lasts about 2.5 seconds.  The visual in game does a perfect job of showing how large the hitbox for the Grasp actually is, so it won't play any tricks on you.  After the ability completes, Sigma receives about 1/4 of the damage he took as bonus shields that decay after a couple seconds, like with Doomfist's passive.  The max (to my knowledge) is 400 bonus health. **Remember, anything** [**D.va**](https://D.va) **can eat, Sigma can too.  This includes Graviton surge and other ultimates**

&amp;#x200B;

Second/E ability - Accretion: 10 Second cooldown. ~~You throw a rock at them~~ Using the power of **Gravity**, you collect a large lump of debris and hurl it at the enemy, causing a fair amount (5 meters, max) of knockback and a ~~very short stun~~ stun that gets longer the farther away you are from the target with a direct impact.  This ability is very slow, with a full second wind up time an a very slow projectile with a decent arc.  A direct impact does 80 damage, with splash doing a min of  25 at 2 meters away.  Note that you can be affected by the knockback as well though it isn't enough to warrant anything other than to avoid using it when you're right next to a cliff.  What's interesting to note is that it doesn't appear to be able to be absorbed by Matrix and Kinetic Grasp.

**Accretion + Primary fire burst = 200 damage, and will likely be the bread and butter combo for any Sigma main.**

And that pretty much cover's his kit.  What's his role? Difficult to say right now.  He does do a good amount of damage, and has a easily movable shield, so I think he'd fit best with a defensive spam team, or an in your face brawl comp.

There just seems to be an odd pattern with which flags get included.

Overwatch lacks exclusive content/rewards for those who give it their all, I mean even the top 500 icon isn't anything special... you can get it from playing Lucio ball which is quite honestly a slap in the face to those of us who really did hit top 500.

&amp;#x200B;

Overwatch just feels lacking in this area, it feels like an unfinished system, and don't even get me started on the thousands of competitive points I've acquired, I mean sure thanks Blizzard I appreciate you acknowledging my hard work/skill but what the hell am I supposed to do with them other than buy golden guns, wheres the rest of the content? shouldn't there be tons of exclusive cosmetics I can purchase after all these years?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean honestly, it makes more sense to stick with season rewards such as a cool skin, and nice avatar, it needs to be said btw that the current seasonal avatars are absolutely atrocious (sorry someone had to say it) the same way League of legends has been doing it, and instead just remove the Competitive Point system because Blizzard doesn't even care about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from the numerous skins any casual player can get, I guess id just appreciate some kinda gesture in return from Blizzard, its something I really appreciate about Riot Games, they go all out for their players who have put in serious dedication, not to mention that end of season grind to hit the rank required for the skin was always incredibly exhilarating (the most fun I've ever had gaming actually) also its always awesome hearing everyone talk about your skin in game, it feels really good.

1483,"So role queue is available on the PTR, and while I'm really excited for the change, I also have a concern. 

I was in a match in which one of our tanks left, leaving us with 2 dps, 2 healers, and one tank. While this was still okay, having the ability to change into another tank would have been optimal. Obviously with role queue restrictions however this was no possible.

I understand this can be an issue - what if the player comes back? If so - what would their role be ? Could this be exploited.. for e.g. if the player x signed up as tank was doing garbage then leaves the game if he/she came back could they transition into dps/heals therefore not affecting their SR?

I'm not sure. One thought that comes to mind is to simply allow individuals to fill the missing role until the player comes back. This would mean an individuals could fill the tank role tank (in my case),  and if the player happens to come back the individual that filled the role instantly gets locked back to initial role queue position once they die. 

Maybe this is a stupid idea and once someone leaves your basically screwed anyway. But I've won my fair share of 5v6 with some smart changes... so that made me a little concerned. 

Thoughts?

Edit1: Can i just say - I really appreciate all the feedback being posted to this thread.

Hello! Seeing as Sigma has been released, I thought I'd take a look back at the recall animation to see if he or any other hero that has been released since the game came out was shown at the end of it. In the end of the animated short, when Winston initiates recall, a lot of agents can be seen on screen, but the speed of them being displayed starts going rather quick, and you can't make it out too well.... Unless you slow down the video to 0.25x and pause every split second like a maniac!

&amp;#x200B;

I did that! I've compiled a picture album of all the UNRELEASED Overwatch agents that appeared in RECALL. All the others are the heroes that came with the game (the ones that I did not take a picture of obviously).

&amp;#x200B;

I also think that it's possible that not all of these agents will be released. Some of them kind of look like early models of heroes already in the game, such as 2 of them resembling reinhardt. Anyway, let me know your thoughts! Link at the start obviously.

This is a text-only version but some specific parts (namely Ana, Lucio, Junkrat) could really use a video version, if anyone wants to give that a shot.

ANA

Ana can sleep Sigma when he is channeling Gravitic Flux, and therefore cancel the ult. If Ana sleeps Sigma after Gravitic Flux was activated, the ult will resume, and Sigma will sleep in mid-air. People are still able to wake Sigma up in this scenario, even though mid-air sleeping heroes normally have to wait until hitting the ground before they can be woken up.

BRIGITTE

Kinetic Grasp can block Whip Shot. Shield Bash will not be interrupted by Accretion, and Brigitte can stun people through it.

D.VA

Defense Matrix does not eat Accretion. D.Va can activate Self-Destruct before being hit by Accretion to avoid being knocked down by it if it hits the mech.

GENJI

Deflect does not work against Accretion. Deflecting Hyperspheres will reset their lifespan (they normally have a range of 25 meters, so if Genji were to deflect them at 20 meters, they would travel 20+25=45 meters total).

HANZO

Kinetic Grasp can absorb Dragonstrike, given that the arrow itself is absorbed and not the dragon. Upon completion, Sigma will play the voiceline: ""The Dragon has been consumed."" (forgot the last word).

JUNKRAT

Kinetic Grasp can abrosb Concussion Mine, but not Steel Trap. If Sigma is trapped while using Gravitic Flux, he will still be able to levitate a slight distance above the trap, with the trap attached to his legs.

LUCIO

Lucio is able to use Sound Barrier in mid-air against Gravitic Flux, and does not have to touch the ground to activate it. Gravitic Flux will then deal damage to each player equal to half of their max health, not taking temporary shields into account.

MEI

Ice Wall does not block line of sight with Gravitic Flux. Cryo-Freeze can be used as Mei is launched upwards to stop forces from being applied to her, effectively launching her in the air. This tech can also be used against Orisa's Halt. Sigma can absorb Blizzard. Ice Wall blocks Experimental Barrier's movement, but Cryo-Freeze does not. Blizzard can be absorbed with Kinetic Grasp, at which point Sigma will play the voice line: ""I felt a chill!""

MOIRA

Moira can fade out of Gravitic Flux. Kinetic Grasp can absorb Biotic Orb, but will not absorb the damage beams coming out of an orb (Kinetic Grasp does not absorb any beams).

ORISA

Like Mei, Orisa can use Fortify to block forces from Gravitic Flux. If used while rising, Orisa can propel herself in the air with this tech.

PHARAH

When absorbing Rocket Barrage with Kinetic Grasp, Sigma will say the voiceline: ""Justice has embraced me.""

REAPER

Reaper can use Wraith Form to escape Gravitic Flux.

REINHARDT

Rein's Charge can be interrupted by Accretion. When Sigma channels Gravitic Flux, his default levitation height will save him from Earthshatter.

ROADHOG

Kinetic Grasp can block Chain Hook.

SIGMA

Kinetic Grasp cannot absorb Accretion.

TRACER

Kinetic Grasp can absorb Pulse Bomb, at which point Sigma will play the voiceline: ""Not fast enough!""

ZARYA

Kinetic Grasp can absorb Graviton Surge, at which point Sigma will play the voiceline: ""I have harnessed the harness."" or ""Gravity is shackled.""

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing Sigma's reveal today (which was totally awesome, by the way), I was in disbelief that some of the most popular replies on Twitter were being disparaging of Overwatch's roster, claiming a lack of diversity.

&amp;#x200B;

*""Another old white man?""*

&amp;#x200B;

*""Because the game doesn't already have enough white dudes? C'mon.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that this is an extremely misguided and unfair judgement. Conversely, I think the creatives on the Overwatch team deserve to be applauded for their character design and diverse representation -- there aren't many popular games on the market that can rival Overwatch when it comes to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get something straight first:

&amp;#x200B;

**Representation does not mean the erasure of ""old white men"". Representation does not mean ignoring the many interesting traits about a new character (physicist, psychopath, musician) in favour of reducing them to an ""old white man"".**

&amp;#x200B;

Quick reality check: of the 9 heroes released after launch, 5 have been women, 1 has been a female robot, 1 has been a hamster, and 2 have been black men. Sigma is the first white man to be released since launch.

&amp;#x200B;

However, a good character is more than their skin colour, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, or even species. What I love about the cast of Overwatch is that all this diversity is seamlessly interwoven with compelling personalities and backstories that are at the forefront of their character design.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on and say so much more, but instead, I just want to thank the Overwatch team for creating believable, awesome characters that just so happen to be incredibly diverse and representative as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh -- and remember, ""old white men"" still exist within a diverse world.

Short answer: Is it a viable hero in the current state?

If you play him as an off-tank, maybe. But I would delete his Accretion (E) ability and give him more mobility, in exchange you can nerf his Experimental Barrier (R Click) and his ultimate damage. Give his Kinetic Barrier the same control of D.VA’s Matrix (I can’t believe they made the same mistake twice). Overall, I see him as being more useful as a harasser/denier off-tank, blocking sniper nests and ultimates and dealing burst damage behind shields and corners than trying to outperform other “main tanks” in holding chokepoints or pushing payloads. 

Details:

400 life pool (300 Normal HP + 100 Shield HP) – No armor, half of Zarya’s shield plus half of Rog’s life, so it is an off-tank then? Ok.

Hyperspheres (basic attack – L Click) – 2 projectile shots, area damage, max range of about 15 meters (kinda OK), but the real magic is the 2 times ricochet effect on surfaces. Real useful for harassing the enemy team behind their shields and corners on choke points. Decent burst damage on squishies. This skill brings something new to the table, so far so good.

Experimental Barrier (R Click) – Wow Jeff, did you just gave a 1.5K 360 degrees infinite ranged barrier to an Off-tank? Alright, so it is a main/off hybrid kinda tank? Be aware, once you positioned your barrier of modest size, you need to spend a cast time to call it back and then cast the ability again in order to reposition it. That can mean your death if your enemy knows how to exploit this vulnerability window, so I find more comfortable to fulfill the role of an off-tank and use this ranged barrier to ruin ultimates and block sniper nests, instead of being stuck at the frontline.

Kinetic Barrier (L Shift) – This is not a Zarya bubble. It only covers your front and can only absorb projectiles, converting them to Overhealing (temporary dark blue shields). Another downside is that this ability is a concentrated casting (like Moira’s ultimate), once you’re casting it you can’t cancel it nor use any other ability. This should change like D.VA’s Matrix, giving you more control. Overall, this ability is mostly useless since players can either stop shooting you, use different kinds of damage or outmaneuver you and “backstabb” (Really fun to use while Reaper is ulting tho).

Accretion (E) – Long casting, too short knockdown, burst damage, blockable ability. It is an intensely telegraphed move, which makes it predictable. I would trade the burst damage for less casting time and more knockdown. If you manage to hit a squishy, you have a small window to cancel your basic attack animation and hit two shots, instakilling the poor soul. But with this casting time I wonder if it is even worth trying.

Gravity Flux (Ultimate) – So far the most useful skill in his kit, though it’s a little tricky. Once you cast it you can fly (hold space) and a large area circle will appear on the ground. Left click it to second cast the ability, all enemies caught up in the area are stunned and lifted on mid air, remaining vulnerable to damage, after a short time, you smash them on the ground dealing massive burst damage. Remember that you cannot use any other ability while casting your ultimate but you can still use your basic attacks to shoot whatever you want. I wouldn’t change anything in this ability. Squishies will complain that the damage is too high, I’d say he’s a sitting duck for most of the match. Kinda of a tradeoff going on here.

1545,"A game that capitalizes on diversity and unique designs should reach for opportunities to make the character stand out. With Sigma, they leaned into the notion that asylum patients aren't given shoes because they could potentially harm themselves with the shoelaces. 

From an art design standpoint, this is a reasonable basis for why he doesn't have shoes, and it's a great note to complete the character's design and set him apart from the rest of the cast. And it plays into the themes of freedom and imprisonment that are intrinsic to Sigma's character concept and fantasy. 

Where it's problematic is that it makes a very straightforward association between mental illness and suicidality; folks in an asylum are by definition mentally ill, and depriving them of shoes in order to mitigate the opportunities for self-harm would be a practice taken even if the patient didn't otherwise present any suicidal tendencies. Sigma is characterized as being disturbed, and accompanying that with an appearance that fully associates him as an asylum patient helps connect those dots more clearly. 

Thus, the problem isn't that Sigma is a character aligned with the ""bad guy faction""; it's that as a character who is so strongly associated with mental illness AND suicidality, he perpetuates dangerous stereotypes about those struggling with mental illness. The stigma surrounding mental illness that causes some to avoid seeking help is only made worse when ""if you're ill it means you're suicidal"" is the message communicated by this design.

**TL;DR: Sigma is mentally ill and his design is justified based on asylum patients being suicidal. Not all mentally ill people are suicidal, and mentally ill people who ARE suicidal don't need something that could potentially trigger them into harming themselves.** 

Blizzard should Lead Responsibly and find a way to address this matter. 

PS: It's the future. Most people's shoes don't even have laces, cars and trucks and motorcycles don't have wheels, and the simplest possible explanation for why Sigma doesn't wear shoes is because HIS FEET LITERALLY NEVER TOUCH THE GROUND SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF WEARING SHOES?",Sigma's lack of shoes needs a different explanation,0

Sigma can be stunned out of his ult

bongo + nano with ult can kill squishies

dont think baptiste can boost him

&amp;#x200B;

enemy lucio can use ultimate whilst in air

brigette shield bash inactive whilst in air, same with rein charge I believe

&amp;#x200B;

If you shield a friendly sigma whilst he's using damage absorb, you do not gain charge as zarya.

&amp;#x200B;

Sigma's ultimate can:

\-  be activated through enemy symmetra wall, even if standing on other side

\- stop winston jump

\- stop rein charge, so it an save from enemy pin

\- Lift bastion in turrent mode

&amp;#x200B;

it cannot stop DVA bomb or lift it up into the air.

it will throw bob in air and make him start shooting immediately, so this probably isnt a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

hammond cant slam out of the ultimate, but Orisa can fortify to drop out of it. Sombra cant teleport out of it either

Hammonds ultimate cant be lifted up, same with torbjons turrent.

junkrat can call ult at the same time to stay on ground and use ult, but will still take damage

Dva can call mech at same time as enemy sigma ultimate to avoid all effects of ultimate

&amp;#x200B;

His kinetic grasp ability can **absorb** mei ultimate, zarya ultimate, sleep dart, tracer ultimate, hanzo ultimate as an *arrow* before it

turns into dragon, moira damage balls, mine, eats some of torb's ultimate, but doesnt last long enough to absorb all of it,

It cannot absorb baptiste disc, so that can be thrown past him. Mcree's ultimate, even if mcree is boosted.

It can basically absorb infinite damage for the duration of the ability, but will cap shield boost at 400.

&amp;#x200B;

his shield can block sombra's ultimate if you stand behind it, but not if you stand to the side of it, unsure about standing on the edge so that only half of you is shielded. Also worth noting that fitzy tested this whilst having half his shield inside a fixed wall. And sombra on the side

&amp;#x200B;

While watching the reveal trailer, I noticed something interesting with Sigma's pen at around the 1 minute mark:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Snipped at 1:00](https://i.redd.it/68d3xy9jjwb31.png)

Look at how it's shaped as a cross:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dcrjfdjnjwb31.png

This is reminiscent of something called the Einstein Cross, a distant quasar whose light is bent around a galaxy in front of it due to gravitational lensing. The four points of light surrounding the center are actually one object whose images are curving around the foreground galaxy (center) due to light being bent by gravity.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g7o88yq7lwb31.jpg

Notice how even the locations of the pens are basically in the same position as the points of light.

&amp;#x200B;

I have suspicion that this would indicate that one of Sigma's mechanics would involve altering bullet/projectile paths either defensively (pulling them into a black hole) or proactively (moving them around obstacles to hit enemies).

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: typos

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2: One thing I also noticed from the trailer is that Sigma states ""if the unifying theories are correct...""**

&amp;#x200B;

This is likely hinting that in the Overwatch universe, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are joined together in a grand unifying theory, considered the holy grail in modern physics. The link between the two is likely due to Gravitons, subatomic particles that produce the force of gravity in the realm of quantum mechanics. This is already hinted with Zarya's Ultimate: Graviton Surge. This would imply that Sigma plays with gravity and black holes in a similar fashion to Zarya's gun; I would go as far as to say that her gun's technology may have been influenced by Sigma's research.

This is the basic concept behind Sigma's Ultimate Gravictic Flux.

* Regular sized heroes like Lucio, McCree, Genji, Ashe, etc are slammed fairly hard, so they take 100 Damage.

1595,"Hey, all. I got to watch some of FitzyHere's stream as he was testing out many different things in a custom lobby and what Sigma can and can't do. I didn't get to watch the whole thing, but here are some of the takeaways I saw.

**Experimental Barrier:**

* Will disappear if Sigma is killed

* Can't be EMP'd if they only see part of the barrier sticking out of a wall, the middle has to be in LOS of the EMP

* You can choose the distance it stops and it stays there for a while (till destroyed?) and it works like Rein's, in that you can press right click to take it down and use a new one as long as it still has health

* Can block a shatter only if it's touching the ground - if it's slightly elevated it will not.

**Kinetic Grasp (converts incoming dmg to shields):**

* This thing is basically a DM. It can eat anything DM can eat, it seems (orbs, fire strikes, pulse bombs, etc..) but can only eat a certain amount of dmg, so he can eat like two or 3 shots from Torbs ult and probably not much from Pharah (i didn't see her test)

* Dragons, beams, etc.. will still hurt him while using Grasp

**Accretion (Rock thingy that stuns):** 

* Works as a stun. Can presumably knock anyone out of an ult that any other stun can - was tested on Pharah ult. Works on Rein charge, even when someone is being pinned.

**Gravitic Flux (Ult):** 

* Any hero that can't ult during Grav can't ult during flux (Doom, Junk, etc..)

* Sym and Mei walls cannot block it by removing LOS

* You can use any CC cleanse to get out of it (fortify, wraith, ice block, etc..)

* Friendly Hog can hook people out of it and they'll still take the fall dmg

* Will lift Bastion while in turret mode

* It looks really funny when they are in it and your Zarya gravs them while floating - they still take fall dmg after grav

**Miscellaneous:** 

* He can be hacked out of his ult if hacked after hitting Q but before selecting a location

* Baby Dva can negate all dmg from his ult if she re-mechs during the ult, but before being lifted into the air

* Bongo + Nano + his ult = insta death for squishy heroes

* He cannot head shot

* Lucio **can** use beat while suspended in Sigma's Ult, for some reason (could be a bug)

1597,"Sigma's balls are dodecahedrons, or what tabletop gamers would recognize as a d12. Dodecahedrons are one of the five Platonic Solids, which are 3D shapes whose faces are all the same regular polygon (in the case of dodecahedrons, they're made of 12 pentagons). They're known as Platonic Solids because Plato hypothesized that the classical elements were each made of one of the platonic solids. Fire was made of tetrahedrons (4 triangles), Earth was made of cubes (6 squares), Air was made of octahedrons (8 triangles) and Water was made of icosahedrons (20 triangles).

In Plato's time, there were only four classical elements, which meant that the Dodecahedron was left over. Of it, he wrote "" ...the god used \[it\] for arranging the constellations on the whole heaven"". Aristotle later defined a fifth element known as Aether, which is essentially Space Stuff. He didn't relate Plato's definition of what dodecahedrons made up to his new element, but a whole bunch of people did after him, as you can see in [this](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/kepler_elements.jpg) picture from Johannes Kepler.

So Sigma, who seems to have some sort of control over spacetime and gravitation, uses a shape associated with space through Ancient Greek philosophy. Is Blizzard being unusually obscure? Or is Sigma just driving all of us crazy?",Sigma's balls are an obscure reference to Platonic philosophy,0

To start, people who guessed Mauga (a significant chunk of guesses) were not *entirely* wrong. While Mauga was not the hero, the kit Sigma uses was originally designed with Mauga in mind. When the moveset didn't match with Mauga's aggressive personality, they created Sigma to fill that role.

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Sigma Origin Story ---

*Camera begins on Sigma’s whiteboard, who in this scene is now referred to as whiteboard Sigma, where he begins writing equations relating to gravity. He can be seen in a typical lab suit, having a very determined face. His lab, which is primarily blue and orange in color, can be seen behind him. His voice appears to be excited and relaxed in tone.*

**Whiteboard Sigma**: “Gravity. Gravity is a harness…my entire career has been devoted to this idea, to this moment. Decades. If the unifying theories are correct, we will soon be able to harness the power of a black hole!”

*The equations start to violently vibrate on the whiteboard, creating a loud noise, soon followed by Sigma himself vibrating alongside them.*

**Whiteboard Sigma**: “Nothing will EVER be the same!”

*The screen quickly changes to Sigma, who in this scene is now referred to as lab sigma, now wearing some sort of gravity spacesuit equipment, in a new anti-gravity lab, with space seen behind him and things floating around him, including damaged equipment, supposedly on some sort of space station. Sigma, who appears absolutely terrified, is heavily distorted, with two of him surrounding a black hole in the middle of the room, which is violently reacting upon the surrounding area. As it does this, golden rays of light surround the black hole. The loud noise from before is even louder now, being omitted by the black hole.*

**Lab Sigma**: “WHYYYYYYY!?!? THIS IS WRONG! THE FIELD IS FADING! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!”

*The screen quickly changes to Sigma, in this scene now referred to as Subject Sigma, now strapped down in a medical carrier going down a laboratory hall, in an orange jumpsuit with “Subject: Sigma” written on it. He appears to be heavily distressed, heavily breathing and looking around in nervousness. A strange melody is beginning to play in the background. His voice has also heightened in tone and has a nervous tone to it.*

**Subject Sigma**: “W-what happened? Where am I? Why am I being imprisoned?”

*Sigma’s head begins to very violently shake as a rumbling noise occurs in the background. His voice also deepens in tone, sounding enraged.*

**Suit Sigma**: “RELEASE ME!!!”

*The screen quickly changes to Sigma, in this scene now referred to as Suit Sigma, who is now standing in a suit of green and white armor (think Lex Luthor) in some sort of disaster site. Rubble of buildings can be seen floating around and behind him. He appears absolutely enraged and psychotic staring at the camera, with his hands being raised upward, as if he is actually controlling the levitation of the debris. Pieces of his armor are also in the air. The rumbling gets louder.*

*The screen quickly changes back to Sigma’s imprisoned state, with the melody now playing even louder than before. The equations he had written on the whiteboard now begin to appear on the screen. His finger also appears to be twitching.*

**Subject Sigma**: “What is that melody?”

*The equations and Sigma begin to vibrate just like during the black hole scene. The black hole’s sound effects begin to play too.*

**Subject Sigma**: “Hold it together. Hold it together.”

*Sigma heavily distorts, with three copies of him being scene in front of the viewer.*

**Whiteboard Sigma:** “Hold it together!”

**Suit Sigma:** “Hold it together!”

**Subject Sigma:** “Hold it together!”

*The camera now cuts back to Lab Sigma while he is in front of the black hole, with the background being Subject Sigma while he is strapped down.*

**Lab Sigma:** “Density! Mass! Momentum! It is too-“

*Camera cuts to Subject Sigma, who is seen sitting in the normal laboratory that Whiteboard Sigma was in. The markers he was using to write on the whiteboard are now floating beside him, occasionally shaking.*

**Whiteboard Sigma:** “It’s too much to hold on to.”

**Background Whispering:** \[Backwards\] “This harness...”

*Camera cuts to Whiteboard Sigma, who is now in the Anti-grav lab. All the debris around him can be seen floating. The black hole is once again in front of him, but he is not distorted by it.*

**Whiteboard Sigma:** “I will bring you a new understanding of the univ-“

*Camera cuts to Suit Sigma, now standing in the Anti-Grav lab.*

**Suit Sigma:** “VIOLENCE!”

*Lights begin flashing red around Suit Sigma. Camera then cuts to Subject Sigma laying in his bed, as he slowly rises up. Lights are flashing red around him. Gunshots can be heard all around in the background, notably from Reaper's shotguns and Widowmaker's sniper rifle. Sigma, for a half of a second, disappears from view before returning with a smirk on his face. There is a heavy distortion sound.*

**Lab Sigma:** “THE UNIVERSE IS SINGING TO MEEEE!!!”

*Camera cuts to Lab Sigma laying in his bed. His smirk has disappeared. The background of the lab floor is spinning around him, as an ear ringing sound is playing in the background. It gets louder as the tiles and his bed beneath him fall, revealing a universe background.*

**Lab Sigma**: “WHAT IS THAT MELODY!?!?!”

*The ringing stops, leaving Subject Sigma floating in space, with it rotating behind him.*

**Subject Sigma:** “Freedom.”

*The black hole forms in front of Subject Sigma as the bed and floor rise back up.*

**Subject Sigma:** “Imprisonment.”

*The background stops spinning.*

**Background Whispering:** \[Backwards\] “Hold it together.”

**Subject Sigma:** “It’s all an illusion.”

*The screen quickly changes to black. The melody and a loud vibrating sound start playing.*

**Whiteboard Sigma:** “Gravity is a harness.”

*The screen quickly jumps to a view of the original lab, with Whiteboard Sigma holding the black hole in his hand. The screen then jumps to Suit Sigma, with the black hole now being in his other hand and now having an electric purple aura, surrounded by the rubble.*

**Suit Sigma:** “I have harnessed the harness.”

*The screen jumps to in front of him to show his full form. The black holes have also now become encased in dodecahedron-style cases, and there are now two of them. The members of Talon then appear around him. Reaper and Doomfist are in front of him, while Widowmaker, Moira, and Sombra appear behind him.*

**Background Whispering:** “Hold it together. Hold it together. Hold it together.”

**Suit Sigma:** \[Backwards\] “RELEASE ME!”

*Screen fades to black before displaying the Overwatch logo. The origin story ends.*",Sigma Origin Story Script,0
1619,"For an easily countered hero, Hammond is a niche pick for certain compositions.

Right now he can be paired with another tank and still be fine.
But since the ptr patch that introduced role queue, Hammond is nearly a throw pick with the current bunker/Orisa hog meta.

They nerfed the ever loving shit out of his minefield.

His mines spread so far, making kills improbable. Especially from the air, making mines+piledriver no longer viable for area denial.

To make it worse. SIGMA showed up today. He can right click and immediately clear every mine and make a really easy path forward in under 2 seconds. The mines are so spread out that it’s not even really needed anyway! But in a tunnel or small choke, he can blast em easily.

(Just for anyone who doesn't know, the old shield used to be 1000 hp on a 10 second cooldown that started as soon as you pressed the ability, and would move forward until it a wall or other environmental object, then would break)

1: Bare minimum change would be pressing it again makes stop in air, keeping everything else the same (would be similar to how Orisa shield functions)

2: You can throw it out and make it stop, but the cooldown doesn't go unless you ""bring it back"" or its destroyed (Not too big a fan of this, number tweaks would probably be wanted in this case, perhaps 50% less hp but at half the cooldown)

3: My personal favorite cause I'm enjoying how it works very much, just make it exactly like Sigma's shield right now, with a shield health that recharges when not in use. 

Numbers could and probably would be changed for any of these

A Sym redeploying her own personal shield(s) right in your face as she left clicks you sure would've been interesting though.

I'm extremely curious how the community / dev opinion of her would've been if her shield worked differently back then.

1) Rock throw doing more damage with distance to reward the skill shot.

&amp;#x200B;

I think role queue is a really great idea, and from the community responses I can tell people are really excited for it. I think it will be fantastic for the overall health of the game - the Overwatch dev team seems to be (as usual) really in tune with the game and the playerbase.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping to bring up a few thoughts from the perspective of a smaller portion of the population for whom role queue would have a few minor potential drawbacks. I'm not arguing against role queue, just throwing out some ideas that could potentially help improve it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to explain my situation first, and then talk about what I think could be done to solve it within the upcoming role queue system.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Issues**

&amp;#x200B;

I typically play with a group of 3-4 friends of about the same skill level, and only solo queue occasionally. My friends and I are all happy to fill pretty much any role always (one of us does all 3 roles, one leans towards tanks/dps, and the other dps/heals, while our 4th plays less frequently but is happy to fill whatever as well as he can).

&amp;#x200B;

Within the roles we all have particular heroes with which we do better or worse than one another (one's a great Mei, while another is a much better McCree, etc). Over the course of almost every game we find that we need to swap heroes to counter the enemy comp, or perhaps we want to change because of the map we're on. Let's say we could really use a sniper, but our only somewhat-respectable sniper player is on a tank. We'd have him swap to sniper and one of us currently on dps would swap to a tank. Situations like this are frequent, and figuring out what heroes you need to counter the enemy comps is a lot of fun. That Tracer been backlining you on Mercy all match? Have your buddy switch to McCree and punish her for it. It's a big part of what makes playing with your friends really fun.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be very frustrating to know we could be doing really well if we were not restricted to one role. As Jeff mentions in the role queue developer update, team comp is everything and having more control over your game and experience is a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't want to be obligated to try to play something I don't enjoy because my team feels we need it and I'm the one locked on that role. I'm super happy to play Widow (and every other hero) as best as I can (usually terribly) when it's the hand I've been dealt in Mystery Heroes, but to actually select Widow and make a team deal with that on purpose? I'd rather not make them suffer. Let my friend who enjoys sniping do it when needed, and let me take his role please. With role queue as it will be released, your ability to swap roles is taken away, which limits the flexibility of people who are willing to work together for the good of the overall match.

&amp;#x200B;

I know role queue is a much wanted and much needed feature, so I was trying to think of a potential solution (or at least a rough draft of one) that could work well within the new system.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Solution**

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I'm throwing out the idea of a role swap request, where two players could choose to swap roles during a game if needed. This maintains the 2-2-2 balance of role queue, while maintaining the flexibility of the current system. Certain limits would need to be put in place to prevent abuses of the system of course.

&amp;#x200B;

You would definitely need to have the two swapping players be within a certain mmr range on their respective roles. You don't want two people queueing with their low-ranked roles and swapping to their high-ranked roles for easy games, so I think this would need to be quite strict.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the ability to block swap requests, or only allow swap requests from friends would also be helpful/necessary to avoid spam or “social pressure” as it was called in the dev update.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to reiterate that I'm not complaining about role queue, and I'm sure I'll have a blast with it! I just wanted to try and throw some constructive feedback out there that I thought might be helpful. Thanks for reading!",Role Swap: A Role Queue Feedback Idea,0

**Cons:**

* Primary fire range feels terrible and you don't have any Hog Hook equivalent to make enemies play in it
* I feel like the shields from his Shift ability should stack at time of damage, not at completion of cast
* Shift ability maybe should be on resource pool?
* E ability has waaaaay too long of a cast time for the damage/CC amount of value
* I think his RMB Shield should have some sort of a UI element under the crosshair, I frequently lose track of whether it's deployed or not and don't want to check the bottom corner in a fight
* Please let the RMB Shield deploy on single click instead of having to hold it for half a second, it feels really weird when I tap it for a shield right in front of me and Sigma just waves to the enemy

Currently his ult is only counterable by counter ults (though sound barrier may be patched to not be as effective against it), or if people are specifically playing CC resistant heroes (Orisa, Mei, Zarya, Roadhog to a lesser extent, and characters with fade). 

I do believe that the ability isn't strictly overpowered in its current form, and its likely that in a proper team environment it can be nullified. However, currently it is inescapable on the sides, where as soon as you have been lifted up you are, bearing exceptions, certain to receive the full effects of the ult.

The ult has obvious parallels to Zarya's ult, but it doesnt feel good to have high damage coming that you have no way of preventing, even with proper shields.

1709,"EDIT: u/spoopyghost_1 noted that what sounds like Death Blossom and Moira’s Fade can be heard in the video too. Did the entire premiere Talon tier show up just to break this guy out? Just how powerful and valuable of a living weapon is he?!

At around [1 minute and 10 seconds into the Sigma origin story video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onplsJSdp4A&amp;amp;t=70s) released today, you can hear a distinct rifle shot that sounds exactly like the unique and unmistakable noise of Widowmaker’s personal, one-of-a-kind sniper model. Between that and the concurrent visual of Sigma lying in a stupor on a stretcher, I hypothesize that he is being wheeled down the corridor of a containment facility that is probably some kind of high-tech, high-security mental hospital for dangerous patients (possibly manned by Overwatch) when Talon swoops in to “rescue” him, Widowmaker spearheading their strike team’s firepower. We can presume that at any rate Sigma ends up in Talon given the visual at the end of the video featuring him in his “tank” suit, surrounded by all the Talon members in their present-day getups. I hear a lot of people suggesting he is “evil” in some sense, whether by this association or otherwise. I’d like to present an alternative narrative for Sigma:



- He began, obviously, as a scientific genius who played with metaphorical fire, let it get out of control, and paid the price.

- The catastrophic failure of his experiments caused him to undergo extreme mental and physical spacetime delocalization and desynchronization, comparable to that experienced by Tracer during the Slipstream accident.

- Either as a direct result of the accident or through built-up trauma and physical distress, Sigma became outwardly mentally nonfunctional (hence the lax appearance of his face while on the stretcher in his origin video).

- Unlike Tracer, he was unlucky enough to be squirreled away in some faceless facility (possibly under Overwatch control, depending on timelines) instead of taken in and fixed by a good ~~man~~ ~~monkey~~ ~~ape~~ scientist like Winston.

- Talon sent a team, including at least Widowmaker, to successfully extract him from this facility.
- Once at Talon, Sigma was either too lost, literally and/or figuratively, in the accident that had scarred him, or too mentally damaged, to process Talon’s morality and higher objectives for him as a new agent or member of their organization, and was easily manipulated into becoming their pawn.

- The tank suit Sigma wears at the end of the video features shoulder pad styling that is uncannily similar to the shoulder pads Moira wears, so I think it’s a good bet she (or someone at Talon who in turn had dressed her) had at least a ~~claw~~ hand in the creation of this suit.

- This is pure speculation, but I like to believe Talon furnished him with the tank suit we see him wearing at the end of the video, providing him with a way to mentally and physically restabilize, and then, once he had become lucid again, blackmailed him by informing him that the tech they’d used to save his life and bring him back from the edge was proprietary and exclusive to Talon, so if he didn’t do as they told, they’d remove his support and make him a drooling vegetable again. Perhaps the good in him that I like to believe existed before his troubles began caused him to try to to rebel against Talon’s grooming at first, but as the years went on, he was broken down into the man we see today - cold, intimidating, speaking of a need for violence. Or perhaps he’s so lost in trying to figure out where he went wrong, and in the pain of his accident, that he isn’t aware of Talon at all (and his call for violence is the primal culmination of his frustration and anguish over what has happened to him).

I just think it would be really cool to play multiple games as the same hero, but in between games instead of choosing which skin you want equipped, just leave the choice up to randomness.  I know that some people wouldn't want every skin they own included in the randomness, so a feature could be added alongside this to have a pool of selected skins for each hero.  That way if you only like (for example) Pumpkin and Soldier: 24 Reaper, you'll be able to play as each of them without having to pick which one you want to play as when you get into a game.  For me personally, I think it adds a lot of variety to the game, which I love.

I for one feel like killing a playable character or two and/or doing a big terrorist strike somewhere would be something that makes them a good villain organization in my book. And they need to do it soon since there are rumors of an overwatch 2 announcement and Talon doing something big would be a good way to end the story of overwatch 1 and kick off overwatch 2.",Hot take: Talon is a boring villain organization,0

1726,"# Many reasons why this would be a good idea:

1. Graviton is already very hard to eat in the first place.
2. The cooldown for the ability in question is high enough to enable ample counterplay.
3. Unlike absorbing other projectiles, Graviton is an ultimate on its own, and it is very slow to build compared to dragonstrike, etc. Meaning it will take a long while before Sigma is even potentially able to eat it.
4. Best reason out of the bunch: ""**I HAVE HARNESSED THE** ***HAR******^(N)******E******^(S)******S.""*** Lore wise this is excellent. Eating a gravity field generating sphere should have an effect on Sigma imo. It is not quite a black hole, but Sigma's entire awakening is that Gravity is a harness, and that he had *harnessed the* *harness.* Meaning he has found a way to use gravity to his own advantage.  


# Also reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea:

1. This would make Zarya even weaker than she already is, as using graviton surge isn't a safe idea anymore&gt; (not only there is a chance that it gets absorbed, but there is also a risk to give the enemy team an advantage!. .... ^(tho genji can))
2. Sigma already gets buffed by his ability with the extra shields, so it will be hard to balance another buff on top of that.
3. It would make Dva weaker against deathball comps.  


In my opinion, the pros outweigh he cons. What do you think?  


As far as the buff itself, maybe it could give him an instant refill of his ultimate bar. Think about it, he eats the graviton surge, and uses it against the enemy team! Same displacement mechanic. I mean Genji can already do it with his E ability (technically). Also after testing in PTR it turns out that the hitbox for Sigma's ability is very comparable to GEnji's deflect. It isn't as easy to eat a grav compared to Dva, for example.",Suggestion: Make Sigma have a temporary buff when he eats Zarya's graviton surge.,0

I'm thinking Sigma would be the most powerful so far in the Overwatch world. Of course it's hard telling because we can only speculate as far as to his full potential.

Controlling gravity itself and black holes. It's kinda hard to top that.

So the scientist Sigma was able to harness the power of a black hole, from what we saw, but the singularity event caused him to split into two personalities: The meek scientist that doesn't know what's going on and the ""Sigma"" we see in the green suit that is all about destruction.

1750,"After Sigma's release on the ptr I immediately went testing. This hero is epic, I believe that Sigma is an offtank but I think blizzard want us to use him for maintanking. Anyways here are the stats.

Primary fire: 60 dmg direct hit

YEET Rock: 80 flat

Initial lift dmg from ult: 50 dmg

Ult dmg: half of hero's maximum health

1-shit combo: 2 direct hits and a rock yeet(pretty hard to do but possible)

Nanoed dmg: 50% original dmg + original dmg

Primary: 90 dmg direct hit

Yeet rock: 120 dmg flat

Initial lift from ult: 75 dmg

Nanoed sigma does not increase the main damage of the ultimate so it still stays the same.

These are all the stats that I know of as of now, I will continue testing to see if there is anymore stats like mercy dmg boost and see how much it impacts the character.

Thx and have a great day!

Edit: 

Mercy Dmg Boost: 30% of original dmg + original dmg

Primary fire: 78 dmg

Rock Yeet: 104 dmg

Initial lift of ult: 65 dmg

Just like Ana's nano the drop dmg of the ult does not increase.

The same amount of damage can be said for a discorded targets. 

Bongo dmg increase is the same as nano since both damage boost is a 50% dmg increase",Stats for Sigma that I know of,0

1752,"Hey friends.

Sometime, or long-time, casual Overwatch player. I'm not amazing at FPS so tend to solo casual queue, and found Overwatch's role-based system worked well for how I think. Still one of my top 5 online games of all time :)

I initially played on PS4, but found as time rolled on most people mained DPS, didn't stick to the payload, or whatever, so I noped out (still installed, but haven't played in a long time). A sale last year saw me re-buy on PC, where I found the community generally much better at doing their jobs - good mix of tank vs. DPS or whatever, and people sticking to the payload so much it was like a dry-humping convention.

Alas, my PC's not in a good physical place for gaming... but I saw the recent [sale on Xbox](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/p/overwatch-legendary-edition/9p2q994zwb64), and wondered about picking it up. My question is, if I pick this up will I find games where people play the game type (e.g., sticking with the payload), not a generic FPS?

A search of Reddit shows a bunch of people asking if the Xbox community is active, but not this specific boggle (OW is still one of the [most popular games in my region](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/store/most-played/games/xbox)). I don't want to start a platform-based hatewar on skill or anything, this is me trying to understand if the playerbase on Xbox gets the overall meta and plays as a team (...salt aside). I'm ready for your downvotes, I'm asking from a position of ignorance so it kinda comes with the territory.

*(I saw the recent role-based changes from Bliz, which has my interest up - enforcing role types could be significant to curbing weird character choices... I don't play with a headset and ignore chat, so I don't mind if people call me a scrub, I'll never see it. I'm purely interested in whether people play Overwatch on Xbox, or use the game engine to play a FPS with Reaper :D )*",Re-rolling on Xbox - worth it?,0
